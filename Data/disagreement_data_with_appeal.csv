@flavius217 @rui_xu How? They are giving info that the media asked for.,agreed
@flavius217 @rui_xu Are you saying they start at the end and don't explain why he was approached by cops?,disagreed
@spants @rui_xu @jlpauk @flavius217 to have the Supreme Court declare open season for cops on the population is a deliberate decision.,disagreed
@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 What they did today was also a good way to taint the jury pool.,disagreed
@flavius217 @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu I don't understand the double standard of wanting all the info about the cop but Brown's past is safe.,agreed
"@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Ok, so you get accounts from the community he lives in where people already have a distrust in police",disagreed

@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 What? No it isn't. There is definitely no justification for deadly force once he was running.,disagreed
@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 If he was shot in the chest how was he running away?,disagreed
"@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 in your world, it's cool to shoot unarmed people in the chest, but not the back? Or vice versa?",disagreed
"@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Yeah, I would totally expect a kid that's been shot to run away, get shot again, and decide to charge.",disagreed
@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Has that info came out yet?,disagreed
"@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 confused how an unarmed person, charging, retreating, or standing still, is a threat to a cop 30' away",disagreed
@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Did you see him stand 30' away and get shot? No. A few people who have a problem with cops did.,disagreed

"Yes that might be true but are you suggesting that we should be allowed to carry semi-automatics or greater weapons? If our government wants to control us with force they are not going to use pistols and hunting rifles, they will use the military and they use far more powerful weapons. the only way the people could successfully counter that is with weapons of near equal or greater power than what would be deployed by the military or non-violent movement such as the Indian Non-violence peace movement to overthrow the British Empire in India.",disagreed
"You state that guns are a tool that increases the ease with which a crime may be committed. But do any responsible gun owners succumb to rage and utilize the tool that they carry for protection of themselves and others to kill someone? Aren't those feelings of rage and hate we feel internally slightly exaggerated? Would any sane, responsible person be able to act externally upon irritation, even with a tool readily available, to kill someone? I think not. Serial killers and criminals buy their tools to kill. Responsible gun owners, the ones that follow all laws regulating gun ownership, will not use the guns they acquired for a wholly distinct and opposite purpose to kill or hurt others.",disagreed
"You are absolutely wrong about the second amendment being put in place to prevent a British invasion or coup. It was put in place partially to allow the creation of militias. You're also wrong about guns making crime rates go higher, take a look at Switzerland. Men there are required to own automatic weapons and yet they have next to no crime rate. Their lack of a standing army is what was originally for seen for the United States, or a system similar. A small standing army to form the core of a greater force in times of war. That is what the second amendment implies.
Obviously you know little about guns, a shotgun is probably one of the least threatening weapons to people. Their limited range for their weight and length makes them impractical for crime, but perfect for the defense of ones home.
The guns aren't the problem its people and don't start blaming poverty, or education. Just because you're poor doesn't mean that you have to kill someone to improve your life. There are many ways to do that. So long as guns exist people will always find a way to acquire them. By reducing the number of honest, law abiding citizens with the capability to protect themselves from these criminals you're asking for a breakdown of order.
But I diverge from the topic at hand. Point is only an idiot points a gun anywhere near a person they don't want to kill. There's no such thing as a gun related accident, gun related deaths almost always are caused by carelessness or stupidity or both.",disagreed
"Great argument pvtNobody, I couldn't have said it better myself.
Guns don't kill people, stupid people with guns kill people.",agreed
"Yes i could have phrased it better. You are right about the militias but what was the purpose of them? who were they supposed to defend against, not just the british but they were certainly a worry? We have a standing army so why do we need a militia as well?
I'm not a gun expert i agree but i also know that shotguns arn't the most dangerous weapons. Yet what reason does anyone have to own a shotgun? I included shotguns because i feel that there is no justification for owning one not that i thought they were very dangerous.
I'm not saying poor people resort to guns what i am saying is that poverty destroys people's lives and creates an atmosphere of fear. There are poor people who are living the best they can with what society has thrown at them. criminals or gangs might try to recruit the poor since they say they offer a better life. because of society the poor might feel that they don't have much hope and that being in a criminal organization might help to raise them. i understand that most of the poor don't do this but there are a few, especially in a city.
a large reason for our higher violence rates is our society and maybe not the presence of guns alone but guns make it easier.
just because a group in one area are able to control gun violence(like Switzerland) does not mean that a group somewhere else is.
""There's no such thing as a gun related accident, gun related deaths almost always are caused by carelessness or stupidity or both."" and thus wouldn't that be an accident? maybe only an idiot does point a gun near someone they don't want to kill there are still a few idiots in this world with access to guns.
i understand your points about self defense and i think it is the only and strongest reason for not banning guns yet what guns are you talking about? do you think we should be allowed to own semi-automatics?
a lot of the recent gun deaths in the news were when people were not at home. such as at Virgina Tech, do you think people should be able to carry guns to class or in public? what i'm trying to say is if you have a shotgun at home yet are confronted when you're away from home how much use is that shotgun?
lastly i talked about education and poverty because most of the criminals are people who have been treated not well by society. there are those high level gangs that did well but where did they begin what reason did they have to go down such a path? there are too many gun deaths and while there will never be a ban in America i find it appalling that so many fight to prevent gun restrictions and background checks.",disagreed
"Militias still have their place, the National Guard is in a sense a militia. It's composed of soldiers who train regularly but are not professionals. Historically it was not the Continental Army that won the American Revolution but the militias that fought alongside the army.
I would argue that if you are pointing a gun at someone it is not an accident if the gun goes off and kills the person you are pointing it at, period. The only restriction on whether a person can own a gun should be passing a gun safety course.
A shotgun has many uses, and in many ways a shotgun would be a better self-defense weapon than a handgun it has significantly more stopping power and is much harder to conceal.
If you have your shotgun with you then it's a lot of help. There is a significant number of people in the US that carry weapons in their cars for just the sort of situation you describe. That is also the reasoning behind obtaining a concealed carry permit.
Finally you bring up societies mistreatment of people. I honestly believe that people's lack of education and even to some extent poverty is more often than not a result of their own failings. I would be remiss to say that all poverty was something that those stricken by it brought it upon themselves but many poverty stricken people perpetuate their status. More importantly a lack of scholarly education or wealth is no excuse for going on a crime spree.
In short I'll fall back on the tried and true motto, ""Guns don't kill people, people kill people."" It's hard to argue with that logic, modern guns have so many safeguards built in that it is not often that they go off without someone pulling the trigger and never if it's not loaded.",disagreed
"You argue that the caliber of the weapon is the only factor in a fight. While this is a significant factor it is not the only one. Tactics and training are in many ways more important.
Finally the reason why the only reason why the Indian non-violence movement succeeded was because the British Empire chose not to use force. When you discuss a military actively engaging in suppression of resistance you've passed the point where non-violent resistance will work.",disagreed
"I did not mean it to sound like the caliber of the weapons was the only factor. tactics and training are also very important if not more so. but isn't the American armed forces better trained than an American citizen? wouldn't it be better than a militia as well?
I guess i don't see the point of the first part of this rebuttal.
as for the second i should have done some research before bringing that reference up nonetheless non-violence is an important tactic and it may not alone stop the suppression but it could be a catalyst for something greater that could. If they were true to the form non-violence could work, it just would be very bloody.",agreed
"The responsible gun owners that you are talking about, might not necessarily THEMSELVES using guns. Womens and even CHILDREN in those houses feel like using those deadly toys and even try shoot at someone. I am not saying all this in fluke. Just click on the evidence below.

After reading this, you might raise another point that the owners should be responsible and keep guns away and keep them safe.BLAH BLAH!
But, then just answer this, ISN'T IT BETTER NOT TO BUY GUNS RATHER THAN BUYING AND HIDING IT FROM WRONG HANDS?",disagreed
"Firstly, knives and cars are not commonly used to murder people. Cars just cause accidents, that is not the reason why cars should be banned. GUNS ARE A SURE WAY TO FINISH PEOPLE OFF! AND ANYONE CAN USE THEM TO KILL OTHERS, that is the reason why guns should be banned.
Secondly, how do guns serve a great purpose, as you said, in many cases? They help to kill somebody we hate? Well! that is badly justified!!
Moreover, there is no way of ensuring that the people who are getting guns are capable of handling them and are not likely to go kill someone with it.",disagreed
"And that my friend, is why Vietnam was lost. The Guerrillas were indeed poorly trained, compared to the American GI, however they were far superior to the GI in terrain mobility and knowlegibility of the battlefield. That is why a standing militia is often incorporated into the defense force because of their greater defensive potential.
Moreover, the American armed forces is a largely offensive unit, indeed they are trained to deal with hostile environments, rather than sympathetic ones, although some more advanced units are given training in insugency.
Also, the whole point of a militant revolt is to avoid excessive bloodshed on the rebelling side.",disagreed
"mmm, I agree with your first two points, however just because stupid people obtain guns is no reason to ban them. Stupid people are voted for all the time (you know who I mean) but does that justify preventing the election process?",disagreed
"mmm, yes, If we take Switzerland as an example again, they have compulsory consription for all young men where they learn about their automated weapons, discipline, responsibility and all that jazz. It also effectively renders the entire able bodied male population of Switzerland potential, trained militia. Service is optional for women there. Prehaps an educational camp is what is needed for responsible gun ownership.",agreed
Then we should ban so stupid people can't kill people with guns.,agreed
"It's not really accurate to say that Vietnam was lost in a military sense. We lost the war because there was no political backing and withdrew before the job was complete. But the guerrilla tactics used by the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese certainly gave our soldiers a hell of a fight.
Militias are definitely best suited for defense, a well trained militia knows the terrain, prepares for likely invasions and drills often enough that it can deal with any uncertainties. Don't underestimate the strength of an out gunned, dedicated force that knows the battlefield better than the enemy. The American Revolution was one by such a force.",agreed
So we should make driving illegal because a relatively small fraction of the population chooses to drive drunk?,disagreed
"the Vietnamese were defending their home; they knew the terrain. the American army didn't know it nearly as well and wasn't prepared for the war they were going to fight.
I think that if the American armed forces were going to suppress its own people they would be better prepared because of what they learned in Vietnam and far more knowledgeable of the terrain. Also now they have far better intelligence technology than during the Vietnam war.
Before Vietnam and Korea the American armed forces did not have to deal with a solely guerrilla war and thus were not as prepared as they are now.
Lastly, no matter if the rebelling side is using peaceful means or armed as it appears you are supporting, there will be excessive bloodshed. Yes America lost Vietnam(and around 60,000 people) but the Vietnamese lost more than a million troops and civilians at least (I'm only counting deaths). They were less trained and they had weapons but that did nothing to reduce the amount of losses that they endured.",agreed
"Jits

Both are used to 'murder' people all the time. It is true that guns are responsible for the majority of murders but knives are number two and cars are considered weapons by the police.
Your point is that Guns murder people so they should be banned. If that truly is your sole point then that's riduculous because banning guns wont stop murders. Murderers will just use something else; knives, poisons, explosives, their own hands.
Do you really think a criminal intent on killing will say to himself, ""Darn, I can't kill now because guns are illegal?"".
Jits. Do you collect anything, pez dispensers, baseball cards, broken hearts...anything? If you do maybe you'll be able to relate to the need for guns. Think about it.
Guns represent history. Guns represent the ingenuity of man. Guns are one of the simplest, most efficient machines ever created. Take some time to look beyond the obvious...gun kill...gun bad.",disagreed
"I disagree with your point : Just consider the prime uses of the things which are considered weapons by you.
Firstly, the prime use of cars are transportation. They are commomly used to move from one place to another by the common people.
You say that cars are considered as WEAPONS by the cops? They are not considered as a WEAPONS. They are used by cops as roadblocks and chasing activities. Do you think them as MURDERS? Quite funny though! That is a funny point you have raised.
Secondly, just think about the prime use of a knife. They are commonly used in domestic kitchen activities.
Now, think about the prime use of a GUN. Even a child knows that guns are used for killing. (Other than defense in the army, obviously, guns can't be banned for the army). Then why not ban guns, when they kill.
Even the keyboard that you are typing on can be used to KILL people if hit at main areas of the body. All is on the mentality of the people. And, as I mentioned in my first point, presence of gun can originate offensive mentality in the owner.",disagreed
"JITS SAYS

""Jeff Joseph, a law professor with the Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, said police officers are often held blameless in San Diego County when they fire on vehicles if those vehicles are coming at them in a threatening manner.

Firstly, knives and cars are not commonly used to murder people.
Once again they are. That takes care of the first third of my post.
You ignored the second third of my post. I will rephrase. Will the banning of guns stop people from killing? The answer is no.
The last third dealt with looking beyond...gun kill...gun bad. Please take some time to reread it.",disagreed
Why not provide more education to those with guns? Banning guns altogether is not a viable option and not even in the realm of possibility.,agreed
"While I don't think an outright ban is impossible, I do think better education and visibility is a good idea. For instance, every gun should be sold with a bright orange, lockable case with a flashing light on it. Every home containing a firearm should have a sign outside with the number of guns within. In short, gun ownership should be as conspicuous as possible.",agreed
Responsible gun owners know how to protect their guns from harmful use.,disagreed
I think you hit the nail on the head with the black market argument but do you really think that there are enough properly trained and licensed civilian gun owners to challenge the US military? There is no way the civilians could win. That argument is just silly.,disagreed
"Now I'm not saying that all the properly licensed and trained civilians in the U.S. would be able to stand up against the military if a coup occured. But if that did happen, many of the members of the military would get out and join the civilian population and defend the counry's interest. Not every member of the military is a brainwashed drone who will follow any order given to them without thought. But considering that there are many more civilians than there are members of the military would make things difficult for the military. Plus think about the police departments, they can provide a lot of help in a situation where civilians will need defense. It doesn't take long to train someone how to defend themselves with a gun. I think this situation would be extremely rare though.",disagreed
"You make a good point pvtNobody, but at the bottom of the article in your supporint evidence it reads: ""It has none of the social problems associated with gun crime seen in other industrialised countries like drugs or urban deprivation."" Thus, I don't know if comparing the Swiss to the US with respect to guns is appropriate.",disagreed
"I don't understand why this is even necessary. Why should we put ANY faith at all in a civilian staged armed-offensive as the only resort to deal with corrupt governments?
That is plainly an anti-authoritarian, barbaric and paranoid state of society which has no faith in it's democratic and legal system. Civilians don't need to be military trained just-in-case-we-need-to-take-over-the-country. That is more of a problem where such small factions may start gang-based violence than any paranoid delusion of a menacing unjust government.
There is no need for every Bob and Mary to own a gun to ensure a peaceful future. Use your vote, use your rights for a free and peaceful future.",disagreed
"""Only criminals have guns"" thats untrue because the authorities will always also have guns and have better training, tactics as well. If criminals choose to guns then they will also deal with the consequence eventually. Gun control's main purpose is to reduce OPPORTUNITY. Guns make it quicker, easier and less painful to end life. Statistically it is proven that the availability of guns increases the chance of purposeful and accidental death.
There is no reason law-abiding citizens need to defend themselves as they are untrained, do not have full knowledge of the law and eventually cause more harm than good by owning such weapons.
The odds are against criminals and even tho gun control may never be complete, it significantly reduces the likelihood of death by firearm by lessening the chances and increasing the difficulty to acquire firearms.",disagreed
"Ever heard of target shooting or hunting? Also what if you have a varmint problem? And even if you ban guns criminals can still buy guns illegally and then the only people with guns would be criminals...and the police, but what if the police aren't around shouldn't you have the right to defend yourself? Also guns don't mean that people are more likely to commit crime or even kill people. Look at Switzerland, they have the second highest gun ownership rate in the world (second only to the USA), and a large percentage of those are government issued assault rifles, yet they have a much lower crime rate than the US. The problem isn't guns it's poverty and lack of education we should be working on those instead of blaming guns for all our problems.",disagreed
"Ever heard of the Vietnam war, or the 1973 Afghanistan war?
Both had poorly trained, poorly armed forces defeating the two most powerful militaries of their time. Also high tech weapons and training are only a small part in winning a war, if it wasn't don't you think the Iraqi insurgencies would have lost by now? My point is: in a war between the US Army and the American people the army would have a very hard time even if the people only had hunting rifles and pistols.",disagreed
"Yes i have heard about both wars and i even mention the vietnam war in one of my posts on this subject.
I believe i have already explained why i think they are different than today. also as pvtNobody said, the political pressure on America to leave the Vietnam war did have an effect on America losing that war. but that was back in the 60s, don't you think that our weapon's technology has increased by then?
the times have changed and yes the us gov would have trouble attacking its own people, and i would hope that our military would be patriotic enough to disobey orders to attack their own country but the US gov knows America better than it knows any other nation. also god forbid the US might consider using light nuclear weapons on more remote areas, because who would retaliate?
the Afghanistan war against the soviets was lost on their part because they had an awful plan and didn't properly prepare for the war and the afghan forces had assistance from US and the CIA as well as US weapons and money.
To best defeat you enemy you need to understand your enemy, America didn't understand its enemies as well as it should have and that has hurt America's wars.
as for you other post about Switzerland and target hunting and such. if you read pvtNobody also talked about Switzerland's gun policies so there is no need to bring it up again since it isn't new info.
i do agree however that poverty and lack of education are major causes of crimes and i believe i mentioned that earlier as well. like i also said guns may not kill people alone but they give the person a tool that greatly facilitates killing if that is what the person wants at that time.",agreed
"I just want to clarify one point. you are aware that semi-automatics are just guns that reload once after shooting, not guns that can shoot two or more bullets per trigger pull, right? Because the latter is illegal in the US and in most places. (well not exactly, you can legally own burst-firing and even full autos in some states but it's a long and expensive process). Also the large majority of guns owned are semi-autos. And one more thing shotguns are probably the best guns for hunting any fowl.",disagreed
that argument makes sense only if u say that u believe America will have some civil war if it lost it's GUNS or that in some stupid way America can only prevent its self from turning into a totalitarian state if it has guns...,agreed
"What?! Of course it should! Under that logic, all drugs should be legal. Surely you can see a problem with that.",disagreed
"Responsible gun owners simply don't come into it. Serial killers and criminals buy their tools to kill. True, but if they couldn't buy guns, then they would do alot less damage.",disagreed
"Please. Do you really think you're going to take on the American military, and all its subsidiary para-military organizations thanks to the ""War on Drugs"", with your handgun? Citizens have no chance against the government if 'shit goes down'. You're prol-meat if that happens and the second amendment won't do a thing, comma splice and all. The second amendment refers to a time when militia was pulled out of the common populace. If they all have guns, then you don't have to supply them. This is no longer the case.",disagreed
"a majority of americans with automatic weapons who wish to rebel can take on the government.
not to mention on how many members of these military and paramilitary organizations may actually join in the fight.
but it's sad to see people just say (fuck it, if the government becomes totalitarian... w/e, better than the right to arm yourself).
and, the handgun is good for when someone breaks into your house and tries to rape your kids. like what almost happened to my uncle (but he used a gun to shoot the fucker in the back of the head).",disagreed
"No. There is a difference between 'dangerous' and a 'threat'. A car is dangerous because it can run you over but it is not a threat. It can be a threat if it's driven by a mad man.

You look at Iraq and other urban wars and see our politically correct military doesnt really smash the revolts.,disagreed
"You make a legitimate point: the right to bear arms may no longer afford much real protection against would-be despots, and judging from the arguments made in this debate, it may even have lost much of its symbolic value.
However, changing our constitution is something we should never take lightly. The 2nd amendment is fundamentally about preventing the government from gaining coercive power. Taking that away in an attempt to make it harder for criminals to commit crimes would fundamentally change what it means to be a US citizen.",disagreed
That is exactly the argument and is the rationale behind the 2nd Amendment.,disagreed
"Switzerland has a gun death rate of 6 in 100,00. America has a gun death rate of just over 10 in 100,000. England outlawed all handguns and has a 0.6 per 100,000 gun death rate. [1] The facts are pretty clear that in countries where guns are allowed, more people are shot and killed.
In 1999, there were 28,874 gun-related deaths in the United States - over 80 deaths every day. In 1999, 58% of all gun deaths were suicides, and 38% were homicides. Of all suicides, 57% occurred by firearm. In 2000, 75,685 people (27/100,000) suffered non-fatal firearm gunshot injuries.
What, exactly, is the point of guns? The fact of the matter is that America has a culture where guns are OK, and the only thing that is ever going to do is mean a great increase in gun crime. Guns are pointless in this day and age.",disagreed
"The problem is that the police system is not efficient enough to put those superior tactics into play when they are needed most. There are too many cases in which the police never have a chance to respond to a threat before a criminal acts, but an armed citizen in the same situation could prevent the crime.
Gun control does nothing to reduce the availability of illegal arms. There is no reason for a criminal to recognize and abide by gun control laws if he/she is going to commit a violent crime anyway. Gun control doesn't reduce the opportunities for violent crime, it reduces the opportunity for a timely response by a responsible citizen who could negate the threat responsibly and quickly.",disagreed
That provides no logical defense for your side.,disagreed
"After sifting through the grammatical errors, I believe I have found the point you intended to make.
The reality of statistics reveals that the UK's violent crime rate is far higher than that of the US. The UK has effectively disarmed its responsible citizens, but done nothing to limit the black market of arms that criminals are utilizing to perpetrate the crimes. The result is that the criminals have a much safer job than they would if responsible citizens were armed.",disagreed
Making a law prohibiting guns does very little to limit the availability of guns to a criminal. A criminal has no reason to abide by that law if he/she is going to break another one. The black market remains available regardless of what laws are used to disarm law abiding citizens.,disagreed
"So, based on your argument there should be no laws since people will always break them?",disagreed
"That was almost a good point, I was totally against guns before and that nearly dented my opinion.
But then I couldn't help but wonder whether his (Jefferson's) views on the matter would be the same if he could have foreseen the future of ""arms"". That is: mass commoditisation of personal weaponry. The lethality and diminutive nature of such weaponry. The rate of fire of these weapons and the speed of reloading. And whether he'd consider it still pertinent when the government owns and deploys tanks, HMGs and fighters on home soil. Which of course, in order to remove such a government, would require not just pistols and other personal weaponry but at least RPGs and SAMs.
I wonder whether (wish) he would have restricted it (the 2nd amendment) to contemporary weaponry of his time, that is: ""muskets (36+ inches long) and single shot pistols"".
But now I am not 100% for a total ban, as I'd love to see ""Cops"" the TV show with them running around with huge heavy muskets and taking 20+ seconds to reload their pistols. Also Columbine would have gone from un-fucking-believable horror to almost sublime comedy.",disagreed
"FINALLY. Someone who pointed out that violent crimes in Europe ARE HIGHER. Good lord. Stop listening to propaganda. In fact BBC recently did a report on how crime has gotten worse.
Get y'alls head out of the sand. Europe's moving away from government intervention. Were moving toward it. Europe's starting to realize that gun control fails. Were moving towards it. Why do we not look across the pond and realize how much it sucks? High crime, and high unemployment.",agreed
if a robber came in your house you would want a gun.,disagreed
"Shot guns are used for many different application a few of which are bird hunting like pheasant or ducks, they can also be used for trap and skeet shooting. Another thing shotguns have a maximum shot distance of 30 yards so they aren't that good of a weapon. Also semi-automatic weapons have various uses and when you are hunting fast animals you want to be able to take as many shots as possible without having to cock the gun. Another point is that a gun is a tool and the person is the one who kills someone not the gun. And it is now required to take firearm safety to purchase or use a gun and also 80% of guns used in crimes are bought illegally according to the FBI.",disagreed
"well if guns were banned stupid people would not be able to get the guns and kill the other people.Yeah, maybe you did not see when you wrote the ""stupid people WITH"" part.
ban the damn things ban them all.",disagreed
And freedom can be lost with guns in the wrong hands. It works both way.,disagreed
"Guns are illegal in Chicago.
How do you explain Chicago having the highest homicide rate?
Don't worry... I'll wait.",disagreed
"Where'd you read that? The NRA Newsletter?
Highest gun related death per capita: DC, where guns are legal link
Lowest gun related death per capita: Hawaii, where guns are illegal link
And see Xaeon's arguement below.
Chicago is like 15 on the list. link And considering the poverty rate, and that it's the 3rd largest city (and probably the second most dense) that's actually not bad.",disagreed
"Key word:

Yeah its possible for a maniac to get ahold of a gun, but its also possible for a maniac to get in the drivers seat of a car. (see my post)
Perhaps we should ban cars in America?",disagreed
I meant that I wanted guns to be kept in the right hands. I did not mean that I wanted guns to be banned.,agreed
"Actually, no I wouldn't.
If a robber came into my house in an area where gun ownership is legal, I'd have to seriously consider whether or not this person is also going to have a gun; why would they enter my house unarmed if they knew that chances were that I would have a gun? All this is going to do is cause a shootout, with most likely someone (50% chance it's me) getting shot.
I'd rather hand over my stuff (it's just stuff), claim on the insurance afterwards and have a greatly reduced risk of ending up dead.",disagreed
"Oh, thats cool, I agree. Sorry bout that.",agreed
"Uhhh? You ever heard of a black market, the illegal selling,buying, and distribution of contraband (weapons,drugs) illegally?",disagreed
"Do you realize your talking about empires, which existed hundreds of years ago, when there weren't ""hardcore"" gangsters and a black market, people abided by the rules or wouldnt have life.",disagreed
"In case you different do other research, Chicago has one of the highest crime rates in the entire country. Crime rates equals criminals which means if guns are illegal, they must be getting them from somewhere, hmmm, i wonder where, black market or illegal selling across borders anyone?",disagreed
"I find your argument inadequate, circumstantial and irrelevant, comparing overall homicide rates to ""gun related"" deaths.
Chicago is 15 on the list because it's sorted alphabetically... :/
BTW, Hawaii's figures rival those of Chicago according to that same list.
Of course the lowest gun related deaths will be in the the states where guns are banned, duh.
Lowest bun not nonexistent.
DC's highest gun deaths per capita coincidences with the fact that guns are legal there, doesn't mean anywhere guns are legal crime rates will be high.
Plus the DC area has fewer population so the 'per capita' figure will naturally tend to be higher.
Still it does nothing to counter MBurke12's argument.",disagreed
"Actually, if you read the chart I gave you, you'll see that Chicago is ranked 15th. No, that's not just the order it is listed in.
Burke's arguement is specifically that places where guns are illegal has more gun deaths. That's his arguement. That's the arguement I answered. That chart shows conclusively that the opposite is true.
The graph is based on per capita, so that DC has less people is completely irrevelant.
You do know what per capita means don't you? That means it's taking into consideration the population.
You are just going to have to face the fact that places where guns are legal, have more gun related deaths.
That's the arguement Burke put forth. That's the arguement I rebutted. And the facts show conclusively that I am correct.
I'm not sure what your arguement is at all.",disagreed

"Wrong! Last year 2.5 million people were saved by using a gun for self defense. I don't consider that ""almost no cases where an innocent person has defended themselves.""",disagreed
"Have you actually read the newspaper? There are several cases and some that a gun prevented them from being a dead victim. I speak from experience. As for the easy access of guns, criminals would have access to guns in the black market regardless if they banned guns. Cocaine is illegal but some how people still gain access to it...well, how does that happen?",disagreed
probama it would still happen you F*ing moron if they arent afraid of going to prison for killing people they definately wouldnt be afraid to get a gun illegaly.,disagreed
"Look at some European countries that banned guns. Guess what nothing has changed. If people want to kill they will and they will find a way to get a gun to do so! So you want to get rid of hunting, which is a trillion $ a year industry and if you ban guns millions of jobs would be lost. YOU THINK WE ARE IN A RECESSION NOW! You idiot!",disagreed

"Well look at prohibtion in 1919 and on, also known as the Volstead act. Alcohol was completely banned yet everybody still drank. They found ways to drink. People had to brew underground, and drink in underground bars, but it happened. Even major Authorities including police and judges were found down there. The same things would happen with guns, and who would be the people to illegally own guns? Not harmless hunters, but gangsters and other criminals who are dangerous with such weapons. It is still going to happen. Maybe we just need tighter gun laws when purchasing them.",disagreed
"[event]
The society with no guns has five members that buy guns from the black market, they take over the society and create a dictatorship where the men are forced into slave labor camps and the women are sold as sex slaves.
Meanwhile the other society is fine they have had a few disputes with a bad apple or two but they were both resolved without the collapse of the society.

coming back to the planet earth you must first accept that guns exist. If you ban them there will still be a black market, no matter if they are smuggled or made domestically. So the best solution is to regulate and make sure law abiding citizens can buy guns.",disagreed

ever since we put registration on guns and making guns harder to get school shooting started. we need to allow students to carry concealed guns on campus. with the VT shooting if one student had been allowed to carry a gun on them the shooter would have ended it early and many people would still be alive today. it needs to be a law that we enforce to make every home have at least on gun to protect your self,disagreed
"1,145 times a day handguns are used against robbers. 416 times each day women use their handguns to protect themselves from rapists. Overall, a gun in the home is 216 times more likely to be used in self defense than to cause the death of an innocent victim. And even if you don't own a gun, preserving the right of your neighbors to own them is one of the best ways to keep criminals out of your neighborhood.",disagreed
"So let me get this straight... Home invasions almost always means that they are just there for your stuff, that means that they are not going to rape your wife and daughter in front of you while you're tied to a chair then kill all 3 of you after they get their kicks then take your stuff? Uh, who's going to collect the insurance? Probably whoever is not at home durring that time I guess, or some other family members currently not living there right?",disagreed
"Actually, yes. Thousands of burglaries happen every day, and I'm sure in a lot of cases they happen when people are at home. There are not, however, thousands of the scenario you described. So, yes, home invasion almost always means that they are there for your stuff.

If they were to burgle my house, then me. I'd buy some nice shiny new shit, and enjoy it knowing that I didn't get shot in the face because I tried to be a hero.",disagreed
Banning guns wouldn't bring down gun violence significantly because people who are committing gun crimes are getting their guns illegally in the first place. And other countries that have banned guns have alot more variables to consider besides just banning guns alone. most other countries have a much tighter justice system that doesn't give any wiggle room for crimes in general let alone gun crimes.,disagreed
"That is completely ridiculous. If guns were banned, people would get the elsewhere (ever heard of the black market???) and the law abiding citizens would be defenseless. And world peace??? There is no way that's possible right now no matter what you ban. Guns are not the only way violence is carried out. Do your research.",disagreed
If someone breaks into a home the homeowner almost always has the advantage. They know the layout of their house better than whoever is breaking in. when it comes to real-life applications the chances of you geting shot are way less than 50-50. Look it up,disagreed
"""The british aren't going to invade, so we don't need to protect ourselves"". So when an american enters you're home with intent to kill, are you going to defend yourself with a fork? I do agree that most burglary's that occur do not involve a murder or serious injury, but not all home invasion's are with the intent to remove your property. If I we're in the position to put my life on the line, or lose a television, I would rather lose the television. The question is whether this person is here to steal my property or harm me or my family. I would rather have the means to protect myself and my family. If we lived in a perfect world where we didn't have Poverty, Drugs and Poor Education, then maybe I could see youre point. The fact of the matter is we don't. When America gets to the point where I can go to sleep at night, or even go about my daily business and not worry, then I'll consider getting rid of my gun. Until then, we live in a dangerous world where people live outside the law and I feel safe knowing theres an amendment granting me the right to defend myself.",disagreed
"i do not think all guns should be banned, but certainly some. guns used for hunting are fine, but they do not serve any purpose other then that. guns such as AK-47's should be band because they are overkill. do you really need a machine gun to kill a little deer. kind of like how some knives such as switchblades are banned because they serve little purpose.",disagreed
"Not exactly disagreeing with your argument, but guns can also be used for personal safety. Not just for killing ""little deer"".",disagreed
"the are plenty of things you can do before resorting to a gun for safety. i have said this many times. move to a place with a low crime rate, get an alarm, or buy a guard dog. you could also buy a taser or pepper spray. buying a gun for protection is just stupid and paranoid. who would you even be protecting yourself from anyway? a burglar, because most burglaries occur when your not even home, make the gun pointless.",disagreed
just because you make it illegal to buy a gun you will never and i mean never get all the guns off the street because the import guns illegally they buy guns without ffa regulation and peple are not stupid and they will find a way to make themselves weapons such as the book writtem by Bill Holmes published in 2002 titled .50-Caliber Rifle Construction Manual,disagreed
"i dont even see it could come across the mind of any intelligent person that people who are innocent dont use guns to defend themselves, thats like saying if someone broke into your house to rob you and they didnt know you were there that they wouldnt want to kill you therefore having a gun could protect you from a scared criminal.",agreed
people will still get guns and whats going to happen to all the guns all over the world. there will never be world peace. there will always be weapons. people will always kill other people. its as simple as that,disagreed

"This is a very flawed point of view. For one, guns are meant for self defense and to fight wars. Even if we did ban guns people will still get them, how do you think people get weed? Keeping guns legal would keep the black market activity down and with people without guns it would be so easy to rob someone's house. Besides you can't carry a cop around with you now can you?",disagreed

I would like to add that we are a constitutional republic.,agreed
"The second amendment was created for the following reasons: deterring undemocratic government, repelling invasion, suppressing insurrection, facilitating the natural right of self defense, participating in law enforcement and slave control in slave states (no longer applicable). So the second amendment is in place so people can kill other people under certain circumstances, that is of course what guns are for in the first place. Theres good reason why 12 year olds can't vote, or for that matter own guns.",disagreed
"Well if you would like more gun restriction why not just move to Chicago where they are basically banned. First of all, you do not have a right to safety, if your friend was acting in a negligent manner with his firearm and breaking the law then he shall be prosecuted. To demand that other people forfeit their rights as guaranteed by the constitution so you can gain a false illusion of safety and security is absurd, although sadly this is the view of many today. Just about every downfall of a free nation to a totalitarian one begins with irrational fear, then the removal of human rights in the name of public safety. In regard to your ""problems"".
1. Whether or not you object to being in an unsafe situation is irrelevant, you are responsible for your own safety in the end. Don't like it? Too bad, as I said being safe is not a right, it's your responsibility. Easy solution, don't hang out with that guy.
2. People like this do not supply the black market in significant numbers, as most gun owners are not this irresponsible, although a lot of illegal guns are stolen and straw purchases. But nonetheless, it really makes no difference where they come from because as long as there is a demand, there will be a supply, if they can no longer steal guns, they will illegally import them, if they can no longer import them they will fabricate them themselves. Don't think that is possible, then you are very ignorant of reality because they can fabricate fully automatic assault rifles in third world countries with primitive tools and skills, and I have even seen cases of people making a .22 handgun in a state prison.
This argument is so exhausted there's no other word for it than stupid. And it's not just guns, it's the prohibition of anything. This country has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that banning any type of item does not work, and in fact only makes the problem significantly worse. It has not worked with alcohol, the war on drugs is an even more impressive failure and waste of money, it has not worked with the current restrictions on firearms, and will not work with any further ones. If gun restrictions worked in this country, Chicago and DC would be the safest places in America, in which they are not, and Vermont and New Hampshire would be the most dangerous.",disagreed
"""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""
I find is odd all the responses, so far in the debate, have not touched on the main reason, in my mind, why I would never let the law makers take the 2nd amendment away. It's not for the protection of home invaders, it's not for hunting and it's not even for attacks on the street, it's for protection from the powers to be. I believe the MAIN reason we should all support the 2nd amendment is to keep the power of gun ownership in our hands and not in the hands of the government. If all American citizens loose their right to gun ownership the only ones left with the guns are the police.... and this is a scary thought.",disagreed

"woah! what did you say? been bad in britain? im british, and very anti guns, and i find this DOWN RIGHT INSULTING! just like the US smear campaign abour the british NHS.
Lets do the maths here
UK gun related homicide in 1998 - 2000 = 14
US gun related homicide in 1998 - 2000 = 9,369
""BUT WAIT!"" i hear you say! ""what about the population difference!""
so lets factor in the populations and do this per capita
uk = 0.00102579 gun murders per 1,000 people
US = 0.0279271 gun murders per 1,000 people
wow, sombody was wrooong, BUT WAIT IT GETS BETTER
the results were ranked!
Uk = 32nd highest gun murders per capita
US = 8th highest gun murders per capita!
and guess what! IT WAS A 32 NATION REPORT! MEANING THE UK HAD THE LOWEST GUN CRIME RATES OF THEM ALL!

Another thought, did you ever think to REALIZE that the strong violence in strict gun law places came BEFORE the laws did? the laws are strick because the violence got bad, and the laws were made after to try to stop it.",disagreed
"Well a gun is different than big macs and knives, because a gun was solely designed to kill things. And when someone says guns don't kill people, people do, that's like saying pencils don't draw, people do. You draw with a pencil. You kill with a gun.
It would be impossible to get rid of guns. Of course it would be a bad thing because people love their guns for hunting, killing, etc. If your ""great purpose"" of guns is death, than yes, they do serve a purpose. It's my personal belief that violence and hate only results in more violence and hate. If America stopped killing people, no one would hate us.
The two reasons why people use guns in America:
1. Get things like money, power, respect (kill people, hold up stores, stuff like that)
2. Protect us from each other because we want money, power, etc. If we all had equal money, power, and respect, there wouldn't be any competition, therefore no hate, no greed, etc.
We can outlaw guns all we want, but we're always gonna find ways to kill people. You gotta attack the root of the emotion that makes people want to use guns to make people realize gun's won't get any real work done.",disagreed
"REALLY?! That's interesting. Riddle me this: How would one STOP a criminal with a gun who is committing a crime?

You're joking, right? You don't think peoples lives have been saved because they carry a firearm? Why do you think people choose to carry guns in the first place? Because they want to shoot someone?
Let's look at BIG PICTURE, for a moment: GUNS protected the LIFE and LIBERTY and FREEDOM that you now take for granted in this country.",disagreed
"First, AK-47s have to be semi automatic to be available for civilian use. Second, dogs are good for protection, but mainly intimidation. (I have a German Shepherd and a Great Pyrenees so I'm NOT saying dogs aren't good for keeping your house safe). A bullet in a dog will stop any breed of dog you have, even if it is a 100lb+ dog. Also, guns are great for protection. If you have a shotgun, a robber that just hears you when you cock it will think ""#@$%!"" And if it comes to it, a homeowner will normally pull the trigger in self defense (be sure to get him good in the first shot because only the first shot counts as self defense, all the other shots are assault =D). Pepper spray and tasers are do not have the stopping power to save you from a criminal. If s/he is flailing on the ground he can still pull the trigger, and might hit you. Lastly, what has America come to when you have to move your home because of crime rates? If you want to save money, buy a gun and any other form of defense you want.",disagreed

"Regardless of whether or not you think guns cause more harm than good, this is not the issue. We have a constitutional guarantee, a right to bear arms. We cannot simply disregard the constitution when we don't like what it says.
The right to bear arms, is a check on the government. It was set in place to ensure that if the government oversteps it's boundaries that the collective will of the people, could if necessary revolt and start from scratch. It is meant as a last resort against tyranny.",disagreed
"Yes, because 'gang-bangers' got their guns from legal sources to begin with?
Banning guns will stop gun violence, like the prohibition stopped people from drinking. All this would do is create a greater demand for an illegal gun trade.
And again, I must reiterate, that we still have a Constitutional Guarantee to own guns.",disagreed

"We are not a democracy, we are a republic. In case of a military coup', or a bad president somehow holding on to power, we need guns.

The US Armed Forces has 1.5 million personnel. The population is about 350 million. Currently 21.6% of Americans own a firearm. Thats 1.5 million v.s. 60 million. And we have all economic powers on our side. Its hands down, BP and other gas stations have the gas the military needs, and we also have the food they need. We might even be one of the few countries left who's citizens could defeat the military. Also, I just realized this, but in the event of WWIII, we could have 60+ million soldiers. Along with the 44% of the world's military budget, we could easily conquer the world.

Hey I'm all for gun rights but not on campus. Think of all the hormonal students waking up early every morning (god knows what they did last night) and going to class with a sidearm in their jacket. What happens when a fist fight between two boys turns into a shootout. Then the next thing you know someone sees their friend getting shot at and they pull a gun. Next thing you know theres about ten kids with guns drawn shooting at each other. I think that might create a few more deaths on a regulaur basis than once in a schools lifetime a single shooter. But I remeber hearing that in one school shooting students had shotguns in their car that they got to and they brought down the attacker. I think that is acceptable but not unregestered guns in students back pockets.,disagreed

Guns do not kill people . A gun doesn't have a mind of its own . A gun can not pull it's trigger by itself . There has to be a person on the other hand to pull that trigger . That person kills people not the gun . On the other hand every thing else you said I totally agree with you .,disagreed
"That's your opinion and I respect that, but, there still is a chance of a rapist invading your home. If you fall down the stairs, maybe one in a thousand times you will break your neck. I know that is a small chance, but the consequences for that small chance are drastic. Also, just shouting ""I have a gun!"" at a robber, will scare them away. Especially if they can't see you, you speak in as low a voice as possible, and with as much confidence as you can muster. Then, cocking your weapon wil double the effect.
In 1995, an 85 year old man's house was robbed, he shot and killed the robber. Later, the police confiscated his weapon. Three days after that, another robber came into his house, the 85 year old man's body was found strangle in his room. Neighbors say he would have been OK if he had had his .22 rifle. They also said he was commonly robbed, when people would see him working in his backyard.",disagreed
"None of you understand, stopping the selling of guns won't stop criminals. It will allow them to get away with MORE. You people fail to realize if someone is intent on committing a crime they will most likely GET A GUN, stopping the selling of guns will just restrict civilians from protecting themselves. If someone wants a gun for a bad purpose... they MOST likely WILL get one Illegally and it probably wont be as hard as most of you seem to think.
Gun ban = No civilians can protect themselves using a firearm = Criminals can illegally purchase guns, like tons already do. You people are stupid",disagreed

"Guns are need by people outside of the armed forces. If the government told us to turn our guns in it would lead to more violence. Criminals who do not follow the laws will keep their guns or get them illegally. In Australia, the government banned weapons in 1996, after a publicized shooting. Immediately after the ban, armed robberies rose by 73 percent, unarmed robberies by 28 percent, kidnappings by 38 percent, assaults by 17 percent, and manslaughter by 29 percent. The United Kingdom had similar results. We have the right to bear arms and to protect our life and freedom even if you think we don't.",disagreed
"even if guns were banned they would still be sold illegally but the hundreds of children dieing because they think its a toy wouldn't be here anymore if the police and the military kept their guns the criminals with the illegal guns would have a much lower gun supply. I am not American and in Europe you need a license to buy guns which already by far lowers the crime rate. America or the world with out guns would be a better place with less shootings, by far. Guns only protect from other guns and create firefights the military and police may need them but for what does anyone else need them? the police can protect you with no guns you aren't a threat to criminals and they wont have guns.
I rest my case",disagreed
"Do you really think that if the government were to try and take over, that your 22 in your gunsafe is going to hold off trained soldiers with automatic rifles? In today's society there is no reason for guns. The right to bear arms was fine when everyone had the same revolver or single-round chambered rifle, but things have changed a bit since then.",disagreed
"Firstly, I am a trained soldier. And most soldiers never move their weapon's selector off semi.
Secondly, Many civilians own rifles; my brother owns an AR-15 (legally). Many Hunters practically own an arsenal. There are many civilian based ""Militias"" around the country. Many military grade weapons are actually legal to own. Certain miniguns are legal to own in many states, due to the sheer impracticality of committing a crime with them (due to their size). Not to mention the number of weapons owned illegally.
Thirdly, if there was such an event where the civilian populace felt it needed to overthrow the government, I'm fairly confident many military members would resign or defect to join that cause.
Finally, there are 300 million Americans and enough guns to arm everyman woman and child 3 times over, if the civilian population was determined enough, no military force on earth could stop them.
Determination is everything in war.
Remember we lost the Vietnam war because we did not have the will to take the war to it's full conclusion, and we won the Revolutionary war against a superior force because we had the will and determination to fight it until the very end.",disagreed
"The common counter-argument is:
If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns.",disagreed
"Id er have to disagree with you on that. What if they steal some of youre valuable stuff, like computers, and flat screens. what if insurance companies dont cover that. Oh right, youre next idea is probably to put this under guvernment control, as if the government dosn't control enough of our daily lives. At any rate, If someone broke into my home (how would they have gotten those guns with all the restrictions may you ask? Simple, they would have stolen them illegally), I would defend my hard earned stuff. Im not willing to risk it after working so hard to earn the stuff, only to have it stolen. And what if the intruder's aim is to kill me? Am I supposed to just let him? Maybe you people wouldnt mind, but I would. Im not about to lay down my life for some random creep. I would prefer to live, personal preference you know? The only way to defend myself is to bear arms myself.",disagreed
maybe we shouldnt be looking at how people are being killed but who is doing it. fact is go in any prison and what color do you see? black and brown. so if your going to get a handle on violence then get rid of the problem causers not one of our only ways of defending ourselves from them,disagreed
lets say a cop pulls someone over with a trunk full of dope and they have an illegally bought gun. then what? ask him to stop? no police need guns to keep the piece.,disagreed
"great idea! go run for senate. so what do we do with att the guns people have now? o lets go to their house and get them. ya thatll work since some of the people that own guns illegally dont even have a ss# cuz they snuck over here. police are not your personal body gaurd, it is your responsability to protect yourself. lets say 6 gangbangers jump you? they have no guns. just bats. what do you do? band baseball. ignorance isnt bliss",disagreed

lets bann driving and sex and a quick meal and while were at it lets just cover the sun up to.",disagreed

excactly. so protect yourself dumbass. if i was going top rob a house in an area guns were legal or not i would have a gun.because guese what if im breaking the law anyway might as well be a pro at it.,disagreed
"thats a niave and stupid comment, while driving etc is dangerous, the sole purpose of a gun is to kill people.
cars are useful and when used correctly arent dangerous, could be wrong but im pretty sure without sex we'd become extinct, and without the sun wed die
guns have the sole purpose to kill and theres no need to be allowed",disagreed
"with regards to ""guns dont kill people on there own"" no the dont however their sole purpose is to kill and without a gun it is harder to kill someone (granted you canuse other weapons however they are generaly less effetive and arentgoing to harm as man people)
with regard to the fact that most gun crime is from illegl guns, in that case why not make all guns illegal. i maintain that making guns illegal would make it harder for people to get hold of them.",disagreed
"precisely what we are proposing, the fact that all guns will be illegal (aside from certain licenced people) will mean that guns arent allowed and no one has gunsmeaning that the only people with the guns are outlaws and can be dealt with through law",disagreed
"accoding to my statstics thats still a quater of the american homocide rate. also i dont tink that the knife crime is a valid arguement seing as im pretty sure you get more than 11 rounds in a gun.
im not trying to argue that stopping guns will prevent crime, but im pretty sure that if the person in china had had a gun, it would have been a hell of a lot worse",disagreed
"Except that they haven't, can't, and won't be dealt with by the law. The same reason why banning alcohol during prohibition didn't prevent people from consuming alcohol, and the same reason why the current Drug War doesn't prevent people from doing drugs.
Prohibition doesn't work!
Even if we wanted to ban firearms, we have a CONSTITUTIONAL guarantee. The only difference this would do is to disarm law abiding citizens and to strip them of their constitutional rights.",disagreed
"that is a rediculous arguement, thats like saying, people still murder we may as well make it legal.
and this is something i dont understand about you americans, why do you want guns so much? the only thing they are there for is to kill and harm others, the fact that you have some flimsy piece of paper saying you are allowed them doesnt make it right that you should.
i dont see a single valid reason why you should have a gun and yet there are plenty of reasons that you shouldnt have them. as far as i am concerned you did not present one valid arguement there.
the war on drugs we have to fight just like we fight the war on terrorism, it may not be sucessful but its far better than the alternative. the exact same is applied here",disagreed
"On the contrary, it's your spelling that is ""rediculous"". There is no such thing as a ""safe"" murder, murder inevitably always violates someone's rights. There is such a thing as ""safe"" Gun ownership which itself violates nobody's rights, your comparison is nonsense.

Because it is our Constitutional Right. Because they allowed us to earn our independence? Because we have a long and storied hunting culture.

Well you're ignoring the fact that Guns are also used for sport shooting, and hunting. Not to mention the very fact that someone posses a firearm is often enough to scare off a would-be criminal. If this isn't enough guns have in instances been used to defend one's family against home intruders. They are also a safeguard against tyranny.
If criminals aren't following the current gun regulations that we already have, what makes you think they are going to follow a prohibition on firearms? Remember the United States is not an island, we will always have easy access to firearms whether they are legal or illegal.

This 'flimsy' piece of paper guarantees our rights as citizens, it protects us from our own government and it protects us from foreign governments. It has been the inspiration for other constitutions around the world. It extrapolates the views that unite Americans as a people, and has been instrumental in our rise to dominance as a world power. It is the bedrock of my nation and it ensures my liberty.
It may not mean a lot to you, but I defend this ""flimsy"" piece of paper with my very life, not the paper itself but the ideas and principals that it represents. If you don't understand this, you will never have an understanding that transcends your little cultural bubble.

I just listed a bunch of reasons:
-We have a Constitutional Guarantee
-Recreational Hunting
-Sport shooting
-Deters would-be criminals
-Safeguard against tyranny
-Protect home
To say you didn't see a single reason is to say your eyes were closed. You cannot win a debate with denial.
Part of the fear of firearms is with negative cultural associations, particularly with gun crime, but firearms along with just about anything else can be misused, this is not in itself justification to ban or prohibit ownership of such possessions. Knives are used almost as often if not more so in crimes than are guns, the reason nobody is pushing to ban knives is because knives don't have the same negative cultural association guns have.
Please give me the reasons you think we shouldn't be allowed to own firearms.

I think we should attempt to help drug addicts, but punishing people for an addiction is pure insanity. People are getting locked up even for harmless drugs like Marijuana and yet many more dangerous drugs, more addictive drugs, are completely legal such as prescription drugs.
The Drug War, is complete BS, just like your argument.",disagreed
"But you missed the point that by making guns illegal, criminals are still going to smuggle them as much as they currently do. And their only purpose is not just for killing. I would love to own a gun just for show! Like a vase or a painting. I'd also love to shoot a gun just for fun.",disagreed
"i only wish all people out there wanted it just for show, then i would have no issue with it. unfortunately im pretty sure that a majority of people want it for other reasons",disagreed
You shout the criminal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thats why we have them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,disagreed
"Yes and that ""other reason"" is protection. The only people who would buy a gun in a legal manner for an illegal activity are the kinds of people with nothing to live for or no common sense. Either way, they are not going to use that gun very long.",disagreed
I believe that there is a reason the police are trained with a knowledge of martial arts and there is also a reason why they have bullet proof vests and all of that.,disagreed
"yes,your right but thats where the the problem is. People are taking advantage of our right to bear arms.",disagreed
"There are most certainly NOT more gun deaths than anything. In fact, cars kill more people than guns do. Look up a fact or two before you hit submit.",disagreed
"Ok let me say something and don't take offense for voicing my opinion. The very idea to ban a constitutionally gurranteed right is unconstitutional. I am sure that you live in a large city such as New York or Chicago and work in a cubicle everyday isulated from all of the real threats the outside world presents. I can assure you that if some one broke into your house tonight and shot your family your opinions about the right to own guns would change. You would go out and buy a pistol and be waitinag for the chance to use it. I live in North Carolina and this debate is close to my heart. I have seen first hand what happens when whistle blowers like you get involved and screw things up for our country. Our country was based on the fact that a man could buy a gun and live out in the middle of no where and provide for himself. Firearms do not kill people, the person pulling the triggger does that. The presence of a gun for protection or even for recreation should never be challanged and if you have a problem with guns in Theis country go somewhere else. Thank you",disagreed
"I agree with Urstupid , no matter what . . Stupid people will still buy guns illegally . They will find a way , and im not giving up my guns for nobody . i bought and payed for them the legal way . and if someone came in my home and tryed to rob or kill me I WILL have a gun to protect myself.",agreed

"Man where are you coming from, what about CHINA, have you studied the size of their military force, it is not to defend themselves.
Are you are a control freak, I can read into your writings, into power, or YOU have access to any weapon you want and want to keep that control from everyone else.
I wish you lived in a location struck by the Huricane, you could defended all those folks which was raped and killed in the hospitals, in our own country. You can bet you would have disarmed them as well.
You cant stop guns, or crimes, or even drugs. I am also a cop but not a control freak.
You should be DEFENDING the Constitution not burning it down.",disagreed
"In the old days KIDS went hunting and guns were a part of life, we had no issues with guns in the house.
Now with the gun grabber attitude yes there is a problem, return guns and teachings about guns to our kids to be responsible.
My 3 kids are pro gun and they know how to use them responsibly. FACT, your kids may need some work.",disagreed
"I agree with everything you just said, and Defiance was a great movie!",agreed
"That just proves that only people who own guns go against making it illegal. The idea for banning guns is to make it more harder to get it, which is true. It will be more harder to get access with a gun, and therefore less people are shot.",disagreed
in Maryland it is illegal to carry a firearm anywhere but a firing range and your own home. PWND,disagreed
"really... stopping guns is not that easy. with alcohol, when it was banned people could sell it at unreasonable prices. that is how Al Capone got rich. so people would still use guns ""under the table"". who do you think would be the new Al Capone. criminals rob banks, robbing banks is illegal, so if you add them up you get that criminals would not stop using guns because it is the law.",disagreed

"Well being in an area where gun ownership is illegal is not going to have any thing to do with the criminal having a gun. They will have a gun anyway. Breaking and entering is illegal so do you think that are going to worry about carrying a gun also.
The insurance part I totally understand cause I have a lot of stuff in my house and have it all insured and I can replace them. I have 12 GA Shotgun loaded with 00 Buck for home protection. Now when I'm not here the insurance takes over, the gun is only to protect my family. You'd rather hand over your stuff and write it off etc.. what about when they want you wife and daughter to do what they want. Not a cold day is $&ELL;that's going to happen to me. Think about it. You don't have to kill someone just cause you have a gun. You have the option to if needed.",disagreed
"I could not agree with you more. Especially the police being a city government.
There is NO WAY they could be everywhere at once. A gun is the best policy.",agreed
"I don't mean to be a ass, but that is one of the dumbest answers ever. First off it would not matter if guns were illegal in your state or not, if a criminal wants to get a gun they will get one somehow. second off if they knew you were armed i seriously think they would reconsider entering your home. and the third thing is that if they know you are home chances are they are there to do more harm than just steal your crap. learn how to use a gun, be responsible, protect yourself and your family. In the neighbor counties around me there have been three different murders, and they think it is the same people, they are targeting people that are home tying them up and killing them. would you not feel at least a little better knowing you could possibly defend yourself ?",disagreed

"The beliefm that automatic weapons should be banned holds no more water than any other arguement. A gun is a gun. the mmount of fire it produces makes no difference, and in the hands of an ordinary law abiding citizen a tank, granade launcher or nuclear missile does not pose a threat to anyone becuase he has no intention of using it. In the hands of a criminal, an ink pen can be rammed into an eye and used to kill someone.",disagreed
"No cases where an innocent peson has defended themselves with a guin??????? Either you are under twelve years old or you have done zero research. There are hundreds of thousands of cases of innocent people protecting themselves with guns. Woman agains gun control, the second amendment police department are only two places that will tell you how many times innocent people not only have protected themselves but even assisted the police.",disagreed
"That is utterly false. Guns in people's homes have prevented them from being victims of violent attacks in countless thousands of cases, and your militia you refer to was composed of regular urban men, not military men and they were armed. Seriously, you want everyone to believe that the right to keep a gun by your bed does not help keep a person able to grab it in the face of a violent attack and fight back? Do you really believe that the ""police"" would ever be able to respond quick enough if they could even be called? Or do the lives of people who dont have homes with alarms and steel doors matter? Tell you what, the day you are faced with a violent attack and get to experience this first hand, we'll see what you have to say then!",disagreed
"First of all if you dont think we ae run by tyrants, you dont watch the news. Second off, when was the last time we had a leader who inflicted terrible damage on the country, as Obama has, and gotten them impeached? Your arguement is entirely false, and on top of it, I am not worried about using guns to stop some government filled with corrupt leaders. I enjoy target shooting, I enjoy owning antique guns, and I fel a hell of a lot safer knowing that if I am attacked, I will not be empty handed and helpless. End of story.",disagreed
"If someone believes that students with guns would lead to regular massacres, then they obviously have one terrible school system or are afraid of some rotten kids. Aside from that lame arguement, no one is suggesting arming students, we have long suggested that instructors and officials in schools who want to be armed should be, unless of course you are going to argue that principals will go on shooting rampages. Ever hear of that?",disagreed
"You are right on the money. first we banned drugs, and that lead to a drug free country. Then we forbade drunk driving and that put an end to drunk driving accidents. If we just had the sense to ban murder and rape, robbery, carjacking, along with guns........hey wait a minute....",disagreed
"First of all, crime happens on a daily basis, and while auto insurance is not needed on a daily basis, we have it dont we? Second, having a gun does not lead to violence and gang banging, having a mentality that seeks to force your will on another DOES lead to gang banging and crime. I have had guns my entire life and never had one ounce of desire to harm another. And if you actually think countries that have banned guns have less crime, try living in one. New York and Washington DC are hotbeds of violence and murder and they dont like regular folks to own guns. I will also prove my point to you: Where have you heard of nationally famous shootings? Columbine and Virginny Tech as well as Ohio. Guess what, they were ""gun free zones"" and idiots demanded gun bans when bans had failed. Where have you never ever heard of a gun rampage? Gun shows. That says something.",disagreed
Peace for a while? Is that why we have had wars globally for thousands of years before guns were invented? Is that why schools and churches are shot to pieces and gun shows are not?,disagreed

"Guns dont create violence. they are made of metal and cannot kill anything. If your logic is true then carfs cause drunk driving. In england, they not only prosecute anyone for defending themselves, they also pay the criminals for their defense. You could not pay me to live in England. By the way, there were centureis where guns did not exist, yet people felt the need to defend themselves. Why do you think that is? Because the mind of the criminal is the problem, not the gun. No, guns should not be banned, and the day YOU face a violent attacker you will learn that the hard way.",disagreed
"Sure, if guns were banned it would be hard to get them, kind of like it is hard to get a joint, hard to get cocaine, hard to get crack......bull! There are two things that make a gun dangerous, a stupid person or an evil one. The rest of us own guns, work and live around people who dont know we have them and we do just fine. For all you know you've been around fifty people today who had a piece on them and you are alive right now because non of them were criminals. One criminal, and gun or not, you'd be in deep doo doo.",disagreed
Then cars should be banned because they are using drunk drivers to kill people every weekend. And I betcha plenty of those drunk driving murderers would not own a gun because they think it is too dangerous.,disagreed
"While you may be right to assert that ""guns don't kill people, people kill people,"" it is pure sophistry to assume that therefore people should carry guns. People do in fact kill people, and they do it a lot easier with the help of guns.",disagreed
"ya look these kids were messed up.......and got there hands on guns anyway but look at it like this. had every teacher, janitor, principal,etc in that building had a gun how many peoples life's would have been saved??",disagreed
"Saying,"" ."" is like saying,""I say that people should be banned because they are killing thousands of people each week",disagreed
"So you believe that everyone in the world having a gun would, essentially, lessen crime? Everyone includes criminals, thus it will make it far easier for them to commit crimes and murders.

Neither guns nor bullets kill people. People kill people.",disagreed
"Okay i am willing to reason with you lets do a for instince.
Badguy: walks into a store full of 12 people. carring a springfeild xd40 Sub compact okay he only has 1 clip 1 clip holds 9 rounds! everyone in the store has a gun too and want to live!!
Badguy: shoots 1 person
?: how many of those 11 people are going to shoot each other? that makes it 1vs11 Now what's the badguy going to do.",disagreed
"So you are suggesting that in the event of an attack the streets of Australia should be filled with gun wielding civilians with no training of street warfare, no particular leaders, just whoever fancies killing some people runs about getting into their neighbours crossfire as they shoot from the coffee shop at anyone who moves?
Odd that seems like chaos.
If gun violence went down then thats a step in the right direction for violence overall.",disagreed
"the difference is that a guns purpose is to kill while a big macs is to eat, a knives is to cut and a cars is to drive. I don't believe guns should be banned but they should be MUCH harder to get",disagreed
"Okay ingenious, let's think about this. So your going to keep Law-biding citizens from accessing guns so all the law breakers can go out and shoot all the law-biding citizens just to simply protect the estimated 5,000 people from getting killed by Gun Shot Wounds, when really you just killed those 5,000 people along with the other 500,000 people that we're law-biding.",disagreed
"Yes, that is certainly going to stop you from a gunman. ""Dear God.... Please Save This Soul""",disagreed
"Sorry but that is bull. Guns are already written into our history and there's no going back after over 200 years of supporting guns just because some people who weren't properly trained in the use and safety of properly handling a firearm. If guns are taken off the market it wont stop people who seek to cause trouble get their hands on a gun, yes it may make it a little more difficult but in the end you are just disarming good citizens who no longer have the ability to defend themselves. And people own guns for more than the two reasons you listed. I own a rifle for hunting, shotgun for bird season, sidearm for personal defense, another sidearm for just shooting and a 22. rifle for the same reason. people have been killing since the beginning of time, before it was guns it was swords, blunt weapons, bows, hell even rocks and bones. Eventually the primary source of inflicting harm could be another weapon or stay at the gun. my point is just outlawing one thing doesn't mean others wont find other ways of hurting one another.",disagreed
Does that means the freedom of speech should be banned what about religion and right to an attorney i guess that means we shouldn't have any of these either. Actually violent crime rates are going down will more an more people are owning guns.,disagreed
Maybe in America but its like smuggling marijuana it hapens even though it is illegal here. Criminals would still get gun and weapons no matter what the law.,disagreed
"Stupid argument. You're using an extreme example to demonstrate the legitimacy of gun ownership? I can chop and screw your argument down to make it more complex, as you should have done from the very beginning anyway.
1) A mass murder will have some form of mental psychosis, or history of violence. This means that in a state/country where it is required by law to have a full medical and criminal background check cleared in order to obtain a license to yield a weapon, this mass murderer wouldn't have a chance at obtaining a gun in the first place. Ban guns altogether? They'd have to turn to the black market. And this isn't an easy process, either.
2) Let's say where this man lives, guns are banned. If he wants to go on a killing spree he would have to be extremely dedicated to the cause. Whether or not he obtains a gun, this guy is clearly dangerous and will kill with any means necessary.
3) There are more incidences of school shoot outs in America compared to any other developed country in the world. What is the difference between America and the UK, Australia or Canada? Well let's see here... oh yeah. Guns.
4) ""Guns don't kill people, people do"". Hm? Of course - a gun is an inanimate object. However, missing the big picture here. More guns = higher homicide rates. Less guns = lower homicide rates. Are Americans just more violent by nature or are you too hung up on your 2nd amendment rights to acknowledge there is a problem with guns?",disagreed
I absolutly think there is. How many prior service members are in the us right now. WAY more than active duty.,disagreed
"Removing guns from house hold is the worse thing you can do. Let me tell you exactly why as a Information Security Engineer (info sec / IT sec ).
1) Law abiding citizen will obey the law. Regardless if you want guns or not, criminals have ways to find one and kill you.
2) Guns equalize the situation where cops will take 5 minutes minimum to bring some body bags to your house. You either want to use that body bag or you don't.
3) Guns in America was not meant for hunting as a primary purpose. It is your second amendment right / duty to have one as our founding fathers have seen how government abuses its power to fellow citizens. Government should serve people, not the other way around.
4) People kill people , not tools kill people. You say all you want that these equipment make it easier for bad people to do harmful things. However, would you also want to get rid of chances for law abiding citizen to defense themselves. If you say the cops can do it then you are delusional. They don't have the jurisdiction to even search you or run to your house to do things on your property. Go find out about the law.
5) Countries that have extremely strict gun laws don't really work well either. Japan still has high crime rates, they just hide their news. People still kill each other in many different ways.
6) I do agree with fully automatic weapons can be ridiculous since you cannot hit anything accurately and should just spread the harm. However, having a regular semi-automatic firearms should not be excluded in any state or the country. I suggest you go learn about firearms really well before you say stuff.
7) Law enforcement do agree that black rifles do not create crimes. Crimes were made by people who can't afford to have anything. They purchased cheap crappy firearms in black market anyway.
All can all. I know that the bad guys will go to your house not mine for sure. Why? Because I am ready to defend myself and my family for the right of life and freedom of speech. Do you like Commie countries? You can go to China and see how that feels.
Educate your children about firearms and proper manner in society is the key. Firearms are not the problem. US government themselves deals more than any other agencies in the world. Go figure!",disagreed
"phuqster, you have to understand that it was created to defend yourself for thugs, including the evil government. So you really think that what is available is evil vs what is available in military? Go figure.
Only stupid, ignorant, selfish, crazy people kill fellow citizens. With those, they would be put away anyways. I also support shoot on the spot if you see a killing spree or someone is robing a bank. I think that would work really well.",disagreed
"Yeah, cause British people kill each other with something else. Look, guns or no guns, people will die just as much. Killed by guns or killed by knife, fork, poison, cars, rope, doesn't really matter. Culture is also very important. I was living in Asia for 12 years, still as much killing as over here with some other type of murder weapons. I don't see the point.",disagreed
"I don't hunt or kill any life shape or form with any thing that I own with. However, banning a type of rifle is really just ignorant to the MAX. You should learn about firearms a lot more before you say something like AR, AK-47, whatever. It's all about the rate of fire and mechanism of the gun. It's how its made for philosophy of use (PoU). You cannot just ban anything in general because you do not understand how anything works at all. All rifle models including AR, AK, Sig, etc, are made with semi-automatic version for civilian use. I also never like or believe in fully auto weapon, they are not accurate, waste of ammo, and much harder to shoot. I never shot one, but shooting 2 rounds consecutively would already give me an idea. Please learn more about firearms and safety of it before you go out and stay stuff like this. It is not true at all.",disagreed
so you don't hurt plants with your shoes? ,disagreed
"You're a moron. Bad guys will ALWAYS have guns. Hence bad guys. Law abiding citizens won't have one if the law said so. Hence law biding citizen. Bad guys want something and pull out that piece pointing at LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. 2 options, citizens have guns and point back. Maybe bad guy have 1 shot off, maybe not. Or, all citizens scream and run, bad guy unloads on citizens. Hmmmmmmmmm, sure, that will work.",disagreed
"You're an idiot, it happens in U.S. ALLLLLLL the time. Not just in U.S. perhaps, EVERYWHERE!
Shoot out in school is a form of violence. What about gang fights between schools. Maybe we should ban school uniforms too. DERB DERB!",disagreed
But if guns got banned do you think criminals who use guns would just give them to the government?,disagreed

They would have to be found with a gun first. ,disagreed

You are right you are not an American so how bout this keep your uneducated baseless opinion in europe. Thanks,disagreed
"You are completely ridiculous. When the world has no more evil people, violence, raping, murdering etc. I'll give up my defense firearms, until then I'll defend my right to have them and protect my family. Educate yourself.",disagreed
What about the other half? Would you want your family in that half? Think about that.,disagreed
Your a real genius aren't you. It's people like you who will look to people like us when you need help.,disagreed
"Why just for a simple ""Redneck"" as you have stereo typed me and my fellow gun owners, I have to say your an uneducated blind, ignorant person. People have been doing evil things since the beginning of time and guess what the criminals have always been armed with weapons that match that time period. And I WILL BE AS EQUALLY OR BETTER ARMED THAN THE PEOPLE WHO WISH TO DO MALICIOUS THINGS TO MY FAMILY. I will not fight bring a kitchen knife to a gun fight.""unlike you"". And the right to own my firearms and my right to my second AMENDMENT was fought for by my ancestors, which probably unlike you can be traced to the revolutionary war. And who are you to reinterpret the constitution? It says what it says for a reason. Not to be ever changed by any person or government for any reason! I CONCLUDE WITH THIS STATEMENT ""THE STRONGEST REASON FOR THE PEOPLE TO RETAIN THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS IS AS A LAST RESORT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST TYRANNY IN GOVERNMENT"" Thomas Jefferson. Sounds like to me he is on to something.",disagreed
What if the intruder did not come in for your things? Would you be able to protect your family?,disagreed
"Imagine a society in which only the police and higher authoritites have guns. People are greedy and will overstep their privilages. Even though polices officer's duty is to help, their are cops who break the law. And what can we do if they're the only ones who have guns? Nothing. Also, if the government tried taking over there would be more then just one person to stop. Militia would form and revolt. If guns were banned it would do nothing to stop crime. A good example of this is marijuana. Yea, its illegal says the Federal Government, but just about anybody who wants to smoke pot does. People will get a hold of guns one way or another so why bann them and waste time and effort getting rid of them.",disagreed
"You want to know why it's so easy to get drugs? Because people get addicted and need the high, and there is good business behind it, not to mention the ingredients for weed and cocaine grow in the ground, so there is an unlimited supply. I completely agree that guns are dangerous in the hands of an evil or stupid person, but there are also countless accounts of accidental shootings. Point being, guns are meant to hurt and harm, regardless of who owns them and for what reason. I understand that banning guns will not stop criminals from accessing them, but it will surely drop the crime rate and make it much harder to get a gun. Imagine trying to fend off someone who is pointing a gun at you rather than a knife, which situation do you think you'd have a better chance of surviving?",disagreed
We are not talking about knives here... we are talking about guns. You have to start fixing a society somewhere and eliminating violence-inducing weapons is a first and important step,disagreed
"With all my respect, you are mixing things up. Weapons used by the army are a different thing. Weapons used for hunting animals are also a different thing. But selling to just about anybody weapons like the ones I see on TV sold in the USA is simply outrageous. YOU ARE KILLING EACH OTHER! stop this madness please",disagreed
"that's it. Get a gun for every one... you really have a problem in the USA with people supporting violence views such as this one. Safety comes from goodness, trust, peace, love, not arms!",disagreed
"Let is say that guns were banned in America, which would never happen there are too many gun lovers here. But theroeticly....
Wouldbe criminals would get the gun(s) they wanted anyways. And a cheap gun is easy to make anyways. If guns were taken away then they would switch to that or go with shooting people with arrows or stabbing.
Violence will never be elliminated. This task is impossible. Yes according to statistics many are killed by gun but many more are saved by them.",disagreed
"I am not mixing up. Many crimes are also committed with guns that are used for hunting. These assult weapons and guns that are more deadly are bought by collectors and sport shooters. The few who get guns for killing often pre-meditate. They can't get the M16 that they saw on Tv? they will switch to something else. A boltaction hunting rifle or another simiautomatic rifle.
I am sorry to burst your bubble but killings like this will never stop. There are bad men out there that want to hurt others either because they like it, because they got mad at someone, or to better them selves. Getting rid of assult weapons will do nothing.
I do though applaud you for saying, with all due respect. I find few who show some form of respect on this site.",disagreed
Mass murderers should be detected and treated. And should NOT have access to guns. Don't you see where the problem is?,disagreed
"You will never end violence with more violence. There must be a different approach. Education, detection of violent people, information, etc, etc but providing easy access to guns is a poor way of trying to get a safe country. In my opinion.",disagreed
"Never end violence with violence, WW1 and WW2. There are other approaches but many people are impaticent and want to take the easier way. You can't allways detect violent people. I am a calm person, i don't get normaly get mad and i don't lash out at people. I follow rules. You would know this if you knew me in person. Last year though, in Woods class at school, i was bullied and i was driven to the point where i wanted the guy to die. I delt with it through words but if it went much further i don't know what would have happened.
Yes i guess that your point, there is a smarter way around things but this is america. People don't want to get rid of guns. I respect your oppion and understand its points. Its just that i choose the other side.
I can see that none of us will budge; call a truce on this one?",disagreed

IF NO GUNS EXISTED AT ALL..... it still woulda happened...... same amount of people... same outcome... wich is people dead.. i DO think they would of still killed 20 kids and 6 teachers if that was his intention...... never said anything about slapping either... i said that he would train and train... idc if it took 10 years..... he wouldve made it a POINT... to make what he wanted to happen... happen.. he would plan it to the T... and make sure that they died.. if thats what he wanted... one way or another.. without a gun or knife... if thats what he wanted... thats how crazy people work. i dont agree..... if those people ( crazy people ) had a sledgehammer ( a gun) i DO NOT think that they would drive the coffin ( kill people) in the ground faster than if they had a regular hammer... ( their own fists and feet ) ...... Because..... Those people who are crazy enough to do that, are also crazy enough to make SURE it happens.. and put plan, and effort into it... they would learn martial arts, (the kind that can kill people in the blink of an eye ( the same speed as a bullet))... our human body is just as dangerous as a gun... and those crazy ass people would put so much training and planning into their actions that the same result would happen.

Should we let 9 innocent people gamble their lives without gun just so we can lie to ourselves that another 1 out of 10 would be safe. Since criminals find black market and don't obey law.

Also banning guns won't stop criminals getting guns.
Guns can be smuggled to criminals illegally.",disagreed

Therefore, they won't wage war with citizens. However, you do need those rifles to keep the government in check for your own safety.",disagreed

You my friend are and idiot. If I hand a gun to a mentally fit person who knows how to handle the gun then they shall be fine and will not kill someone. Hand the same gun to a person who has a mental issue and also can handle that gun you have a murder on your hands. Banning the gun will not help the unstable person they will use some other weapon to commit the crimes their brain tells them to. Help the unstable person and then no murder.,disagreed
ummm you appear to view the other side. maybe you should figure out which side you are on first. but your point is perfect. I am going to guess you own a gun.,disagreed
"I'm gonna have to disagree with you there. No matter how hard a martial artist trained, I don't see how they could be able to kill people as fast as a semi-automatic weapon. Yes, people would have still been killed, but that many? I don't think so. When I say yes to the question ""Should guns be banned in America?"", I don't believe that hunting guns would need to be banned. Yes, they can kill people, but not as fast as a semi-automatic, giving more time for the criminal to be stopped. I do not see the need for semi-automatic weapons to be purchased by anyone. When you go hunting, I doubt you assault the deer. I do agree with you on what you said about how crazy people will go far to make their point, but I still believe that semi-automatics should be banned. That is just my opinion.",disagreed
"An absolutely ridiculous viewpoint. Those who commit such crimes have access to guns. Remove such access and you have no crime. One need only create a stronger police force, with tougher laws to back them up. The liberals have so weakened our laws against criminals that it is absurd. Capital punishment should be brought back and in greater force. Armed gangs should be wiped out via the use of your military. If you have a military, USE IT.",disagreed
Hunting is an important pasttime? Never heard of a grocery store?,disagreed
"The police are handcuffed by liberal laws which deny them the ability to properly do their job. These days, criminals have more rights than law-abiding citizens. Blame your society, not the police. The threat of death must be held over the head of every criminal who seeks to kill by arms. Ever wonder why there was no crime in the former Soviet Union?",disagreed
"You can be 'enslaved' whether you have the right to guns or not. You are going to use your handgun, with no training whatsoever, against highly-trained, well-equipped soldiers?

"Here, in Canada, it has been discovered that by far the majority of guns used in the commission of a crime originated from the USA. Criminals smuggled them across the border into Canada. This PROVES gun control works. We need only tighten up our border, and the crime ends. Simple. We had only recently begun to arm our border guards, which is ridiculous. Our border should not only have armed guards, but our military should be stationed along the border with the USA to keep your violence out of my country. Those caught smuggling arms into Canada should be shot on the spot. No questions asked. No trial. Nothing. End of.",disagreed
"But, do they not ban drunk drivers from driving again? I see you fail to understand the point of banning weapons. Just as cars do not kill people, but their drivers do, so do the owners of handguns. It is difficult to control those who would own guns just as it is difficult to control those who own cars. We cannot ban cars, BUT, we can ban those who have proven to be difficult the right to drive them. As weapons are not cars, but objects designed SOLELY TO KILL, they should be banned outright.",disagreed

"I am against banning guns in America, but this argument does not make sense. The purpose of a gun is to fire a lethal projectile for the purposes of hunting or protection, and the purpose of a kitchen knife is to cut things for the purpose of food preparation.

That is very true. You'll get far more viewers from covering mass shootings than you will covering a story about how gun related crimes are at a historic low, and still decreasing.

It doesn't take away our inalienable right to protect ourselves, it just makes it harder. One could still protect themselves without a gun, though you'd have to try a lot harder. As for criminals, the fact that some people will break a law is generally not considered a good reason to avoid having said law all together.",disagreed
"This debate topic should be come and solved more early than today. It's already late to ban the guns. Most of the poeple in America are having the gun to protect themselves. If the gun law is abolished, however, it's absolute that some poeple wouldn't give their gun to government. This will occur pople to increase their anxiety.",disagreed

"As a tool, guns certainly kill people. Well, bullets do, rather, but that's nit picking. The person using the gun is indeed responsible, but when one uses a tool, that tool is certainly being used.
So yes, the bullet fired by the gun is doing the killing. The person who holds it simply decides who is being killed. It's nonsense, but that's the nature of this whole ""Guns don't kill people, people do"" shtick that really has no legitimate place in a conversation about guns.",disagreed
"Guns are useful, especially if a government would be susceptible to tyrannism, and I would put verification laws that would go survey and examine ones person mental health etc., Yes it has a legitimate place in the conversation about guns...

"Definition of militia according to Princeton's WordNet: civilians trained as soldiers but not part of the regular army.
The first part of the second amendment (and the only part you cite) says ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state."" This basically says an army of civilians trained to like soldiers, but not actual soldiers, is necessary for our security. It's true, we should have civilians trained in the art of using weapons there for our security, instead of only relying on the police force or military our government provides us with.
The second part of the second amendment (the part you don't cite) says ""The right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" This part says clear as day that we as people, have the right to not just keep our arms, but to also bear or use them. This goes hand in hand with the first part because a militia of citizens can't be armed without this second part.
If you read some quotes from the founding fathers, then you can see for yourselves just how they felt about owning guns.
""The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms."" - Samuel Adams
""The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government."" -Thomas Jefferson
""A free people ought to be armed."" - George Washington
""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms."" -Thomas Jefferson",disagreed
One up vote for the hard work (research). Really good quotes backing your argument.,agreed
"eh, maybe it's because it's mandatory?
plus, we have waaay more people and have much more access to weapons than other large civilizations. this is probably why more of us need to be armed. but not enough of us are armed, so there's more murder. also, since we have more people, there's more crazy people.",disagreed

"Sure it does. To see why, imagine your neighbour had grenades, a tank, chemical weapons, or a nuclear bomb in their house. Would you sleep soundly at night? Might you wonder what kind of use he had in mind for those weapons?
One of the roles of government is to protect people from each other. If Joe Sixpack wants to buy a machine gun so he can mow down a herd of deer, that's fine...in a disturbing sort of way. However, the more destructive a weapon becomes, the more likely it'll be used intentionally on another person for reasons other than self-defense. That's why the public has an interest in regulating, if not outright banning guns.",disagreed
It is quite simple. Idiots can have guns. If you put an idiot and a gun together bad things are gonna happen. To solve this gun buyers should be encouraged to attend a gun safety class.,disagreed

See grenades aren't legal to own in my house. Because they are not a valid source of protection for if a stranger came into my house at night to steal my things and threaten my life.

Are you kidding me!?

Children also get killed by household cleaners should we ban those too? Instead taking guns away parents should put their guns in a safe place that is away from their children.

"So let me get this straight:
1. You state that without guns, we'll get killed/imprisioned/brutalized/etc.
2. I prove you wrong by stating the FACT that other countries have little gun ownership but are not being killed/imprisioned/brutalized/etc.
3. You're only counterargument is an ad hominem attack.
""Guns should not be banned. the police will have even more power over us than they do now.""
I don't see your point. Are you implying that when you're unhappy with the police, you go out and start shooting them, or at least intimidate them with threat of violence? In what world is that valid logic for owning a gun? We're a nation of laws. When police abuse their authority, they're dealt with by the law. Whenever I hear about a dirty cop being exposed, it's due to a reporter or a pedestrian with a camcorder, not some guy with a shotgun.",disagreed
"His logic is that with no firearms owned by the people of a country, it allows things like government, police and criminals to seize power, control its people and turn into a totalitarian state. As I recall such a thing has happened in Europe, Russia and China just in the past century. What happens when the police have power over its people...things like Waco and Ruby Ridge happen, or more recently people in the middle of the Katrina disaster were disarmed by the police state and left to rot in the middle of a destroyed city full of criminals. The job of the government is to serve its people, not take control of people as if they are subjects. The second amendment is the least understood out of everything in the constitution, and little do you seem to know, that if you throw this one out, you might as well throw them all out. Anyone who wants to ban firearms is either ignorant from fear, or does not value their freedom. There is a reason it is the second part to the most important part of the constitution.",disagreed

"Psst, criminals don't plan on following gun laws, so banning guns will not prevent robberies or crimes.",disagreed
"guns have no purpose other then killing. i do not think all guns should be banned, but definitely some. if you like to hunt, then go out and buy a hunting rifle. however i believe guns such as AK-47's serve no purpose. they are machine guns, and you do not need a machine gun to hunt a deer. as for self defense, well there are plenty of things you can do before resorting to a gun for defense. you could move to a place with a lower crime rate. buy a taser or pepper spray. get an alarm or guard dog. besides, what would you need a gun for to defend yourself? if it is against a robber then i should let you know that most robberies occur when you are away from home, making the gun pointless.",disagreed
"Your side sounds more ""against gun control"". Responsible people, in my opinion, are the ones who have been trained and are armed with guns under government authorization. Which is quite rarely an average american citizen. You state, ""but theres some people who use them for the wrong reason and that is what makes little familys cry because there loved one was gunned down by a horable person ;((((((((((("".

"This comment should be under brads comment instead of on the ""arguments for"" side.",disagreed
"This comment should be under the comment instead of on the ""arguments for"" side. This side is for your individual comments, as to debate with you, guns should not be aloud in the hands of citizens because it is the gun that kills the people, the person.
If the person was responsible, you could take the gun out of the situation and someone would still die, this is not true. The gun is what is directly taking the human life. To say that quote is false is just commonly statisticly untrue, as stated in my argument Against; ""For example, during a year when over 5,000 teens and children died from gun wounds in the USA, in Great Britain, where gun ownership is very restricted, 19 teens and children died from gun wounds.""",disagreed
"Although its not your idea, i think its still well formed. My dispute is that hunting and other recreational guns should be stored safely in the place where the recreation is taking place. For example, hunting guns should be stored under lock and key at those hunting grounds, then checked out and returned as not to take them home cause harm to non-deer life like humans.
As for the topic of self defense, guns should not be used as a common self defense. Why?
Lets use a simple example, your walking home in the dark its quite and you think someones following you so have your hand on the gun and keep walking, looking back. Suddenly a car pulls in front of you, startled you naturally turn around and shoot. Theirs no one behind you, but an innocent dead driver in front of you.
Its simple ""accidents"" like these account for most deaths. Having something less likely to kill a person, such as a taser, is much safer. Some people may argue that it doesnt do enough damage to defend somone, but taserd stop your muscles from moving, stopping whoever right in their tracks, alive. We should stop using guns for defense like we do, nothing that deadly should be so self conscious.",disagreed
"Even if a background check is preformed and comes out clean, most americans have no history of gun safety. Also, though americans may be ""law abiding"" they still are animals and have natural reactions, there is NO human alive that hasnt been startled before or scared. Its those feelings that provoke gun use as a defense in the first place. If you want defense against intruders, try a home alarm system, a loud barking dog will even warn you without killing someone. If you want to stop someone, use another form of defense like a taser. Some people may say, but what if they have a gun? If there was gun control, that couldnt be the case, yes there will always be violent people, but without guns there would be less dead people. At school no one has a gun, its just how it is, and in the cases where one was entered into the environment, there was a set plan to stay safe and the deaths are obviously lower from that event, then they would be if guns were aloud daily. Guns make room for emotional mistakes and kill the need for restraint.
I do think gun control will help this country and i am not mistaken. If criminals keep their guns, they wont be able to use them. Why? People if no one had a gun in an area and one single shot was heard, the whole area would be on alert for that one shot and the gun would get confiscated. In countries like great britan where there is strict gun control, this happens all the time. If we just assume its useless cause we have some criminals and just have to bare arms to balance it out then its just twice as dangerous, two lefts don't make a right.
Anyone that is considered a ""criminal"" is on record by the US government and will be searched before the citizens for that reason. The government is smart enough to realize that criminals would have guns, its not something thats just overlooked.",disagreed
"This comment should be under brads statement, but to dispute. Timing may just be a statement but the guns are still the main focus. Guns shouldnt be allow because the defenders want to shoot just as much as the intruders. I think i covered this in more detail when i explained the pros of having citizens being gun free.
Even ""If criminals keep their guns"",(if we were to confiscate all guns) "" they wont be able to use them. If no one had a gun in an area and one single shot was heard, the whole area would be on alert for that one shot and the gun would get confiscated.

"The about 80% of the ""general public"" dont even know a thing about gun safety. Although i agree that criminals should not possess guns, at least most of them know how to use it. Citizens trying to protect themselves should use something that wont kill people with a flick of a finger. Pepper spray can blind, tasers will stop someone wherever they stand, guns click and kill.
I said this in jacobs dispute, but if people were the ones killing people then it wouldnt matter if there was a gun involved.
Umm heres a visual
Person+Gun= -Person
(A person with a gun kills a person)
Take out the gun cause your saying its not its fault...
Person=-Person
If the gun wasnt responsible, and its the persons fault, then it wouldnt matter if the gun was there or not. But infact it makes quite the difference.
Your point about criminals finding illegal guns is just like illegal guns, something just cant be completely erased. But saying outlawing them would make gun rate increase cause they are illegal makes no logical sense. Take a place like school, we have no guns here, and in cases where shootings happen, its much less then i would be if people had guns everyday. Same goes for a biggerscale like the USA. We also have all been trained with the lock down drill, and im certain the government would issue something like that as well.
The people behind the guns ""defending"" themselves are just as trigger happy as any intruder. To just say guns should be aloud because criminals have them, is childish and we need to age past barbaric murder caused by guns.",disagreed
"The bill of rights does not state the an individual citizen has their own right to have their own gun, id read up on that before making that statement. People who live in a bad neighbor hood can move, or live in a protected shelter if moving is not an option. People who consider a neighborhood unsafe often think so because of guns. I myself often think ""someones gonna come out and shoot me"" when walking through bad neighborhoods. If citizens didn't have guns, that would make everyone feel that much safer. In unsafe neighborhoods, there would be one less worry of not getting hurt by some irresponsible citizen with a gun.",disagreed
"I feel like im repeating myself. But to simplify what ive been saying, if the government had gun control they would start out with the high risk people such as criminals and work their way down. Not having guns would be an overall safer environment. A common environment like this is school. Some people argue that there are still school shootings and this is true and also related to your idea of ""its just how things work."" While their are school shooting they are vary rare, just like america would be if we didnt have guns. Schools also are prepared, remember doing those lock down drills? Our country would prepare us the same way. School shootings cause far less deaths then if schools were aloud on a daily bases to everyone (like america now). We should leave guns to the professionals and if we need to feel safe, we should protect ourselves without killing someone else.",disagreed
"Guns dont need a rule book, people need to be trained in what they are using and most citizen have never taken a gun safety course. People do have rights but they should not have the right to end someones life because they were scared the MIGHT loose their own, and thats the self defense argument. If you wanna feel safe there are so many less barbaric and deadly options then a gun. We are humans, not deer. If you pepper spray and tase an intruder, what more can they do? They cant see or move...so they cant shoot you and they are still alive. We do have a free country, we should make it safe too.",disagreed
"That person does not look crazy at all, he appears to be a person who happens to like guns and is responsible enough to go to a shooting range.
By taking away guns from the average citizen you are only allowing the criminals easy access seeing as they will not give up their guns.",disagreed
"So your argument against people owning guns is that since some people might make stupid mistakes then it is okay to punish everyone?
With that logic we might as well ban cars because some people will get in wrecks from being bad drivers, ban alcohol because some people drink too much, and ban kitchen utensils because some people stab themselves.",disagreed
"Guns play a huge role in intimidation as well. If I am strapped for cash and decide that the only way to make any money would be to rob somebody, I think I'd rather rob a store without a gun than a store with a gun.

The gun is a weapon made for the peasents, for those soldiers who couldnt take years to train.

Are you saying a knife would work better when the majority of Americans dont even know how to use a knife??? They would end up cutting themselves let alone their assaulters.

I'm sure if someone was intent on killing a person, they could learn how to kill with those items as well. But I have never killed anyone though, and I never intend to. What it really boils down to is that a gun is only a tool. If someone is deranged enough to start killing innocent people, it won't really matter whether they can have a gun or not, they will simply use another tool. And since there aren't mass murderings on a regular basis (in civilized countries anyways) it's fairly safe to assume that there aren't very many homicidal maniacs out there.",disagreed

In fact, most armed homeowners, when faced with an intruder, are able to kill it or hold it for police without much trouble because they are far better oriented with their home than the intruder. They also have much better mental faculties.

Criminals don't care about gun bans, so a gun ban only takes guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens.""I believe I read not long ago that there are close to 300 million legally owned firearms in the United States. With a house full of guns on every corner, where do you think criminals get them from?
80% of all deaths from firearms are from illegally bought guns, either smuggled in from another state or over the boarder from Mexico (in the US anyway).
Every single massacre has been in a gun controlled area. Columbine, Albertville, Virginia, whereas not a single one has been in places where citizens have been allowed to carry guns. A natural response would be more gun regulation is going to help, but people need to look at the facts rather than just ideology. Think about it: if you were a madman and you wanted to kill as many people as possible, would you rather go to a gun-free area or an area where most people are carrying guns.
Gun regulation is based upon the misled knowledge that if you give a gun to the average person, they will go about trying to kill as many people as possible, but in actual fact the average person is relatively good and sane enough not to do that. The government can stop law abiding citizens from protecting themselves, but they can never prevent criminals from doing so.
What really kills, the gun or the person carrying it?",disagreed
"So people shouldn't have the capacity to defend themselves?

Well, as a child raised by ex-criminals on both sides of my family I can tell you that we would never purchase guns from the store or pawn shops. The best way to acquire guns is via yard sales, or have a person buy the gun for you, that way your name doesn't show on the paper work. Seriously, who is stupid enough to follow gun regulations at face value and get their name attached to a model of firearm? That's just asking for trouble.
Did I mention black market arms dealers? They aren't THAT hard to find.
Also, why in god's name would you steal a gun from an armed house? That's the riskiest thing to do, because you need to know where it's hidden and you always risk being caught in the process by the armed owner.",disagreed
"Many people feel this way.

Simple answer, really. Fun. Why did I build a flamethrower when I was a kid in school? Why do young boys make pipe bombs and enjoy firecrackers? It's fun. Lighting things on fire and blowing stuff up is fun, and having powerful guns is especially so.

Because some of us are drawn to big weapons and would like to see one, and on the down low you can make grenades or buy them and launch them in no-man's land.
What ever happened to just accepting that some of us like to shoot things, blow things up, etc? It's good, clean fun and nobody is hurt from it.
Culture of fear maybe?",disagreed
"With a gun? No.

I see, so banning guns just stops law abiding citizens from having them, yet your family of criminals buys them from people who legally obtained them, or has them legally obtained for them. That makes sense.

Why? I don't know, ask some of the people who stole 1.7 million guns between 1993 and 2002.
Is it really that difficult to case a house for a couple days and figure out when somebody's at work? I don't even come from a family of criminals and I'm sure I'd have no problem doing this.",disagreed
"Because...? It's scary to you?

Laws change through the years, but stockpiles of firearms are decades old. You buy what existed before the laws came into effect. It's obvious stuff.
Of course, you can still believe that banning guns or imposing stiff regulations on them will make them vanish, if that makes you happy or comfortable. It's not true, however.

So less than 1% of your 300 million firearms are stolen, this must be the primary way to obtain illegal firearms.

It's just not really a bright idea to use this method when yard sales are safer and won't get you spotted by neighbors. Yeah, I KNOW you can figure out when the guy leaves his house, but why spend days figuring out someone's patterns of behaviour when you can have someone buy a gun at a store for you, or pick one up anonymously at a yard sale?",disagreed
"No because they didn't actually exist at the time. But the reason for the second amendment is so that we will be able to protect ourselves from the government if we need to. If guns such as M-16's and AK-47's are restricted to government use, then who's more powerful? The people or the government? The fact that someone has a gun is not the point of the second amendment. It's the right to have a weapon to defend ourselves from the government that will tell us we don't need them.
If you gave the average person a grenade or an AK-47, what do you think they will do with it? There's a misconception that they will go mad and shoot everything in sight, when really they will probably lock it away.
Now tell me, what would be more useful during a home invasion: the AK-47 or a hunting rifle?",disagreed
"The founding fathers didn't envision phones, or television, or the internet, should our first amendment rights be limited to things they had like print, and speech?",disagreed
"You make a good point on the home invasion thing but how often does that actually happen?
I don't have any stats but I'm pretty sure there are a lot more accidental deaths from Timmy grabbing dad's AK and playing cowboys and indians with the neighbor kids than dad using it to stop a home invasion, and if a home invasion is reason for buying it why wouldn't a handgun do the trick?",disagreed
"These weapons require a specific, and very expensive, permit to own. So if a man is shot with an m16 or ak47, it would be very easy for authorities to find everyone in the city who owns them and see who did it. Adding to that, People who would go on a killing rampage would not be able to obtain a license to carry these weapons.",disagreed
"What are you saying? That people desire to kill a burglar, or that people desire to protect their family?

So that means that people oughtn't have the right to protect themselves when a break-in does occur?

But it can happen.
A large portion of the people I know have been robbed.

What is wrong with this argument?

And if those 300,000,000 guns were taken away, what would come of the millions of illegally owned firearms?

That's quite the exaggeration

Many places.",disagreed
"What does fund matter when safety is involved?

How did you do it, pray tell!

I don't know; I never did. However, I'd be interested in knowing how to do so.

Both of which are extremely dangerous, however. If you are arguing that the danger/power is fun, I could say the same thing for rape or murder, depending on the person.

They are aesthetically pleasant.

How many people actually know how to make them?

Some of us? Are you saying that you are like this? If so, this is a side of you I've never seen: the human side.

Mainly since the '90s.
I'd say somewhere around the mid-90s: Amber Hagerman, JonBenet Ramsey - the media paid too much attention to these child-murders and people came to accept them as normal.",agreed
"Yes, and they are trying to do so in quite an absurd manner.

Usually it does. That's the problem with not being an American.

That was the old way! Modern Americans hardly even know about the Revolutionary War.

It does, doesn't it? You'd think that people would realize this.

Mainly progressives. They're the exact opposite of libertarians.

Which is the reason that the ""right to bear arms"" was included in the first point.
*However, you didn't really cover accidental deaths in your ""accidental deaths"" section. Wouldn't more lives be saved by taking away all of America's legally owned guns?",agreed
See liberty or death. The liberty of all overshadows the deaths of few.,agreed
"Exactly, which is why anyone with half a brain obtains these guns from shadowy sources, if they intend to commit a crime.",agreed
"It failed due to the fuel not being volatile enough. My parents wouldn't let me manufacture anything more volatile. We had many arguments over these kinds of things, because I was always either planning to create dangerous chemicals, or was on the verge of killing myself by creating dangerous things in the name of curiosity and experimentation.
In hindsight I was fortunate to have them watching over me.

It's all pretty easy to figure out on your own, though.

Maybe, but they hurt a non-consenting party.

Again, not very hard to figure out.

Don't kid yourself.

Yeah. It really made child abduction and murder so much more difficult to accomplish.",agreed
"Parents! Always holding their prodigies back!

My curiosity was found in books. In hindsight, I`d say I was much better off.

As can those types of weapons. A flamethrower - however powerful it was - if used in the right location, could cause anything from mild damage to a forest fire.

No.
It is still extremely rare. It has always been rare.
Children, in Britain at least, are - I think the number was fifty times - more likely to die inside the house than outside. Child abduction is still nearly unheard of. Most cases of missing children, the child is a runaway. Family abduction accounts for most of the abduction cases. A couple thousand are abducted by strangers each year. How many children are in the country? 60,000,000+. They don't have much to fear.
Also, they`d be safer if more of them played outside. Who is going to abduct a child in the midst of twenty or thirty+ friends?",agreed
"You have no idea. I wanted to make a plasma cannon but no one would help me with the necessary components. Plus I kept designing bombs.
I was a troubled child, obviously.

Oh, I read too, entirely non-fiction. It took a lot of persuasion for me to finally start reading fiction. It didn't help that my interests gave me acid burns and powder burns. Try explaining that to the ER: your child has burnt hands from black powder flashback. Yeah, you were better off not looking into these things.

Most technologies we take for granted are as destructive, but we allow them. We should be able to enjoy these weapons.

I was being sarcastic, like ""Drat! Now we can't abduct children anymore to test our latest smallpox vaccine.""",agreed
"Well how often does that happen? The death toll is below fifty a year. Not only am I talking about home invasion, but the general store robberies, madmen in public areas, etc. The death toll for them is above 300!

Some people aren't comfortable enough with a gun like that. If they had something like an AK-47 what right does the government have to take his right away? I have a strong doubt he/she is going to go on a killing spree with it. The government is there to support and protect rights, not take them away. We cannot rely on the government for all our protection, which is why the right to bear arms was put in place. I understand a natural instinct that says more gun control reduces crime, but people need to look at the actual stats!",disagreed
"That's exactly the point! The fact that it is so hard to obtain a gun has created the statistic of 80 percent of all gun crimes committed with illegal firearms. Not only that, the good people who abide by the law cannot protect themselves?",disagreed
"Dumb humanoids.

All children are trouble.

Mostly non-fiction.

I enjoyed the occasional fiction tale - modern, that is - however, I found them dreadfully difficult to complete.

Precisely my argument against cars.

There is a difference, however: the only purpose for weapons is to - you're smart enough to figure this one out, aren't you - whereas, say, vehicles - whilst they can do grievous damage - also have benefits.

Well, you've always got 9disabled children to test it on.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willowbrook_State_School)",agreed
"I just lacked interest. I thank my teachers however for pressuring me into fiction because it opened my mind to many great authors.

Cars have utilities and disadvantages. Flamethrowers too, though the list of utilities is shorter. They aren't only for killing.",agreed
I support this point. Criminals could really give a fuck less what the laws are. They'll get laundered guns anyways.,agreed
"Hey quick question for you...why were these weapons made? They were made for the government, the same government that wants to take them away. P.S. I have many guns and as I stated before the only time have pulled the trigger on any gun for violence was for the government. You folks that think your political party can be trusted are sadly mistaken.",disagreed
"Many reasons. The answers range from war to genocide to hunting to law enforcement to self protection.

That's not their only purpose and it's not that simple.

I often wonder how one can live with themselves after turning a gun upon someone else.

You're mistaken if you think this comment applies to me.",disagreed
"Unfortunately our government has set it up so that we cannot overthrow them, even though it is well within our rights (if not our requirement) as described in the Declaration of Independence.
""...Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness"".
Our forefathers were truly amazing men.",agreed
"Actually it applies worldwide, but most western countries have populations that are fearful and spineless (I'm looking at you Britain, Australia and Canada), so America is one of the few modern nations where owning and operating guns isn't so heavily regulated, and the population has strong, vocal support for it.",agreed
"Nope. There have been hundreds of thousands of cases in which people have defended themselves or others with guns. Look up this link below.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1071444/ 
And comparing Australia with the United States is like comparing apples and oranges. The Australian government is a lot different than the one in the United States. You can't conclusively say that guns are the main factor.",disagreed
"So you want to legalize all drugs too, right? I mean, after all, if someone can't buy heroine from a supermarket, they're just going to go to the black market anyways.",disagreed
"Nope. There's a difference. Using drugs will screw up a person's mind and potentially make them do bad things. A gun will not. It's simply a tool, not anything that will alter a person.",disagreed
"Using a gun could screw up someone's mind. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, remember? But you are right, a gun is just a tool. It is not dangerous, as long as the people holding it don't have evil intentions. And so making automatic weapons legal will decrease the amount people who have evil intentions and wish to have automatic weapons how?",disagreed
"Cars have the power to kill people. In fact, a lot more cars kill people than guns do. Should we ban cars too? What about kitchen knives? Or tire irons? Under you're premise, having a deadly tool can alter someone's mind, so we should get rid of them since they can kill people. And for your second point, most people who want guns for evil intentions don't buy them from a gun shop. They buy them ""under the table"" so to speak. The legality of weapons doesn't matter to a criminal. If they really want an automatic weapon, they'll find a way to get one. It makes no sense to bar them from our law abiding citizens.",disagreed
"I just can't follow the leap in logic that if criminals have/will acquire automatic weapons, law abiding citizens need to have automatic weapons as well. There's just not really a logical purpose for an automatic weapon in a domestic environment.",disagreed
"If criminals have more firepower than the law abiding citizen, it becomes a problem because it puts the potential victim at a disadvantage. There are many instances in which an automatic weapon would be more effective against multiple targets than a semi auto. Gang break-ins for instance. Occasionally in gang related intrusions, several intruders may break in at a time. If they are grouped together, which they usually are, a full auto will take care of them quite nicely.",disagreed
"What you are doing is making an (unreasonable, violent) solution to a problem that may be prevented from happening in the first place through other, better, nonviolent manners. You could have an alarm system for your house, you could have neighborhood watch-people, you could have a guard dog, you could help fund local school systems that will keep teens out of crime while simultaneously giving them an education. Instead of promoting a radical, deadly solution to these kinds of problems, try to use some common sense. You don't need to fight fire with fire. Sometimes water will do just fine.",disagreed
"Alarms systems don't always run a criminal out of your house, and it often takes several minutes for police to respond. Neighborhood watches and school systems are ineffective in a similar fashion. They reduce the likelihood of a break in, but they don't help much once it's already happening. When it does happen and someone gets into your home with hostile intentions, the safest thing to do is to kill them. Preferably with a weapon effective for the task.",disagreed
"><
1. You linked a survey. We all know gun advocates think they're Dirty Harry, find some police stats... you won't be able to.
2. The survey you linked is not about automatic firearms. Even if you are dirty Harry, it only takes one bullet to stop an intruder, not 100.
As for comparisons, you can compare Australia becaue they have a similar socio-political make-up, which is the primary contributor to crime. Other countries with a similar socio-political make-up include the Scandinavian countries, Canada, England, and France - all of which show similar results with greater gun control laws.
Now, you can argue the legitimacy of a handgun, hunting rifle, etc, and I would say it should be a local issue in each case (ie South Central Chicago might want different laws than rural Alabama).
What you cannot do is say that having a oozi is self-protection. It is in the best case overkill, in the worst case a criminal who just has not been caught yet.",disagreed
"Ok, for the sake of discussion, lets throw out the survey. Why is it so hard to believe being armed and knowing how to use your weapons effectively will make you safer?
The reason you can't compare the United States and Australia on the subject of guns is because it won't produce clean results. In order to accurately compare or test a variable, the variable must be the only thing that changes. The United States and Australia have different laws and different governments, so it's impossible to derive a conclusive result about one variable. Furthermore, the socio-political makeup is different in the United States. Countries like Australia, Canada, England, and France all have a lot more socialism for instance.
Part of my argument for this is common sense. If a criminal is lawless enough to use a weapon for malicious purposes, will he really care about the legality of his weapons? There's always a black market to turn to almost anywhere in the world. Also, guns aren't the only way violence can be carried out. If people really want to hurt other people, they'll find a way to do it.
I agree with you that gun laws should be a local issue.
In some cases, an automatic weapon is more effective than a semi auto for self defense (such as when several intruders break into a home at once, or when someone breaks in with armor). I know these cases are very rare, but they do happen occasionally. And when they do, an oozi is in fact a sensible choice. That's why the military uses automatic M-16s.",disagreed
"A lot of things are common sense.
The numbers show that one who owns a gun is far more likely to accidently shoot himself, or have a child who figures out a way to shoot themself, then to ever encounter an intruder. Home intrusions where the owner is home are less common than accidental shootings, that's a fact.
I have no problem with guns, in fact I like them. I live though 2 blocks from the LV strip, and I would ""feel"" safer knowing it was hard for my neighbors to get their hands on a gun, than I would with one of my own.
Very few gun control advocates advocate total gun control, that is a strawman the NRA made up. Most gun control advocates simply want local municipalities to be allowed to look at the numbers and say ""okay, you can have a handgun but not an automatic"" in such and such a community, ""you can carry whatever you want in this community"" or if you're in the middle of the ghetto, maybe you can only own a hunting rifle.
I see nothing wrong with this.",disagreed
"The numbers show that one who owns a gun is far more likely to accidentally shoot himself, or have a child who figures out a way to shoot themself, then to ever encounter an intruder. Home intrusions where the owner is home are less common than accidental shootings, that's a fact.
I believe you will find, however, that the vast majority of accidental shootings are non-lethal. Intruders who break into an occupied home on the other hand, are likely to know the house is occupied, and come prepared with a weapon and have a conscious will to do damage.

I'm actually a member of the NRA, and I have yet to hear from them that the feds will completely ban all guns. What they will do however, is take smaller steps on a slippery slope. Things like bigger taxes on ammunition, a higher charge to obtain certain permits, bans on certain accessories, and even misleading legislation such as the ""assault rifle"" ban that would include many common hunting rifles.

Neither do I. But the problem is that it is a slippery slope. The general trend in the past has been to legislate with continually more restrictive laws, and they seldom get repealed. This is what has gun enthusiasts upset. Trivial laws aren't so trivial when they continue to build up. And futhermore, who gets to decide what is reasonable? You may end up with a county of gun control extremeists who won't let you have anything, or you may have one that lets people have RPGs.",disagreed
"First of all, denying individuals the access to firearms is not a good idea because they will still find illegal ways to posess weapons and this will be worst because in the legal format of owing weapons, the government can keep a registry of firearm owners and monitor them but in the illegal way, the government has no idea who owns firearms and this can cause a threat to society.
Secondly, you cant deny anyone access to firearm because the 2nd ammendment itself does not prohibit giving firearms to civilians. If your standpoint of argument is the fact that firearms increases the level of criminality of civilians, then that argument in itself is a constitutional violation of the civilian rights based on the constitution on which this country was built. Thirdly, guns are needed for protection in areas that have a high crime rate. A perfect example is a young father who i personally knew, and who was also a business man. He was robbed in front of his wife and children and then shot in the head and left to die. Take that for an example and imagine if he had access to a gun for his and his family protection, what would have happened.",disagreed
"Your entire argument is irrelevant.
Your first point merely echoes my point about illegal/illicit drugs (why not legalize meth, crack, cocaine, and everything else because then the government can keep a registry of drug owners and monitor them but in the illegal way the government has no idea who owns drugs and this can cause a threat to society). See, you just substituted firearms for drugs.
Secondly and most importantly, the debate is about automatic firearms. Tell me where I ever wanted to take away your ""God-given"" second amendment (By the way, just to point out, who cares if it's in the Constitution. The Constitution is a man made document, and as such is fallible. That's why there are amendments like the second, and why the Negro is no longer 3/5 a person, and 18 year olds, women, and minorities can vote).

An automatic weapon would have probably been more dangerous in this situation, especially since the criminal would have had a higher probability of owning an automatic weapon as well.",disagreed
"This is not so. Meth and cocaine cannot be used in a positive way since they will always cause bodily harm. Guns on the other hand, can be used for hunting and protection.

The point being made was that banning guns won't help the potential victims. Criminals seldom obtain their guns by legal means.",disagreed
"First of all, meth and cocaine cannot be used in a case of self defense. The whole purpose of legalizing firearms is the fact that it can be used for the purpose of self defence when a person's life is in danger. No one has the right to own these types of substances because by law, they are illegal. Gun is an equipment and not a substance. Meth and cocaine are substances. What are the benefits of owning drugs in terms of saving your lives? Can you use it to defend yourself?
Let me ask you this question, if you dont care about the constitution because it is man made then how come you care about the illegality of crack or meth? Didnt man- made laws made those substances illegal? The ammendments were made to the constitution because as we approached a liberal era, the people gained more rights. The whole purpose of the ammendments are to protect the people from the power of the government when used in an unfair manner. You should be thankful that the constitutional gave minorites and the women the right to vote. The constitution never prohibited in the whole, that right was added on to it to widen the rights of the people.
If the father had access to a weapon, then his life would have been saved. What can be more dangerous than a father losing his life? How much dangerous can it get?",disagreed
"First of all to blindly follow your US constitution in modern days is ridicules because times and ways of life change.
And to answer your exiting question the rest of the family might have been shot as well.",disagreed
"In reference to the Constitution, it is interesting how you fail to mention the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments which are directly amending the Constitution, not just adding things. Also, I would like to refer to you to George Carlin in reference to rights. If something is a ""right,"" how is it possible that rights change with time? Either it is a right, or it is not; it is not subject to the whims of the people, politicians, or populations. I believe in your right to self-defense. I don't believe in your ""right"" to an automatic weapon (especially when a normal, non-automatic gun would suffice).

Perhaps the family gets hit in the crossfire. Or a witness. Or anyone else besides the assailant and victim.",disagreed
"Do you shoot moose with machine guns? Do you need an AK for protecting yourself from muggers?

Where have I said anything about banning guns. Take your guns, fine, you may have that ""right."" That does not, however, give you the right to fire any kind of weaponry you want. If you want to take this back to the founders, they would be appalled at the way people abuse the Second Amendment in order to justify owning frivolous (for civilians) arms. The worst they had were muskets (inaccurate at that) and canons (more so) that came no where near the deadly force of even a handgun today.",disagreed
"Why do you follow the laws that were created 100s of years ago? Arent they man made? And to respond to you, those childre n are orhans now because their father was killed not able to defend himself. Even though the children saw their father killed, at a distance they saw him being shot they could not have been injured.",disagreed
"Hunting with automatic weapons is illegal in the United States and unsportsmanlike besides. Although if a bear is charging at you, it would be good to have an automatic .45 to kill it before it kills you. And automatic weapons are much more effective than semi-autos to eliminate multiple or armored targets (such as gang break-ins, or an intruder with a bullet proof vest).

They most certainly would not. Every one of them thoroughly understood the importance of having an armed citizenry, and they encouraged the ownership of guns as much as they could. Without the strong prevalence of firearms in early America, they could have never succeeded in their revolution, and without the continuation of armed citizens, the government could obtain absolute power and oppress the people.

But the important part was the fact that weapons were evenly matched. People could still kill each other with firearms, and often did in the revolution. Thousands upon thousands of people met their fate at the end of a gun making the gun violence of today a drop in the bucket (despite the fact that they are more advanced). Everyone was well aware of their lethal potential, and yet they were encouraged anyways because when a society is armed, citizens are much more reluctant to commit a crime and governments are much more reluctant to oppress the people.",disagreed
"The 13th, 14th and 15th ammendment was made to the constitution to widen the rights of the people because governments could infringe upon the rights of the people. It is because of the constitution that we are protected in our homes or else the government could barge in and carry out unreasonable searches and seizures and then use that evidence to deprive us of life, liberty and property. Many people misinterpets the meaning of 'rights.' It is not a right itself that changes overtime, it is we the people who give governments the power to take a right away from us because according to Howard Zinn, the government gets it power from the people and power and rights come from the people, not the government. Do you think the constitution was created by a government? Whether you believe in the right to firearm or not is what your opinion is but majority of the population would agree that law abiding citizens have a right to firearms which is why the constitution permitting the use of firearms was never challenged.
If you are saying that we should not give firearms to people because other people might get killed, then what you are implying is that we should take away the means from a person to protect themselves and let them die when we can provide them with the equipment that can save their lives. And by the way, majority of the crimes committed are committed by illegal gun posession and not legal gun posession.
The 13th, 14th, and 15th ammendments were rights bestowed upon the people in the constituion and not changes made to the constitution.",disagreed
"I do follow laws but laws are updated often enough to make most of them make sense. The US constitution is old and could use updating just like any other set of laws.
It's true that it would complicated to revoke peoples right to bear arms but if it would be done It would be for the better. And I apologize if I upset you with my answer to your question regarding the family but what I meant was that the situation could have been escalated to a far more dangerous situation should the father have pulled a gun on the robber. The father would like any other normal person have been slightly hesitant about shooting someone.",disagreed
"It most certainly would not be for the better, and I believe you underestimate American attachment to their gun rights. There are several million gun owners here, and if the right to bear arms was revoked, there would almost certainly be a civil war. Especially considering the fact that most of the armed services would likely side with gun owners.


Most gun owners (in the US anyways) are quite competent with their firearms, and I can tell you from experience, the hesitation doesn't happen when you or your family is in danger.",disagreed
"First of all, most of the laws are updated because of the constitution. In most of the instances, government might create or already have a law that is infringing upon the rights of the people so when a person is incacerated because of the vagueness, ex post facto or inefficient law, the Supreme Court has to interpret the Constitution and then apply it to update the law. There are so many case laws that were created from the constitution and so many laws created by legislators were striked down because it was seen as a violation of civilian rights when interpreted by the constitution.
Do you think, that if we are in a emergency, we can always depend on police officers to save us? Do you think that if i call 911, and there is a man holding a gun, and the cops take appromixately 15 mins to arrive, between the scope of that 15 minuites, i will be begging for my life and defenseless infront of my perpretator only for the cop to arrive and then find my dead body. As it is, many laws are already favorable to the defendant and what you are proposing is a law favorable to the defendant because the victim is not allowed to carry a weapon but at the same time, the defendant will still carry a weapon even if it is illegal for the sole purpose of robbing someone or killing someone.
I agree with you that maybe the situation could have escalated but how do you know that it could have? Are you certain or just making a presumption? How come in many other cases, people that uses gun for self defence dont end up injuring other members of their families in the process of defending themselves. Take for example the Connecticut murders that took place recently, in which the father was tied up, beaten, wife and two daughters killed in which one of the daughter was raped infront of the family before she was killed. Dont you think that if the father or mature family member had access to a weapon, all this could have been prevented? Or are you going to say that somebody else could have been hurt? Cause the entire family with the exception of the father died.",disagreed
"I agree with you. Banning the use of firearms on civilians would most certainly introduce a new civil war in society and more damage to the society than one could imagine. Because if a right is taken awasy from them, then they will see it as a form of dictatorship and hence try to rebel since it is a right granted to them by the constitution. Not only would it create a civil war but the crime rate will also go up because the illegal firearm owners will now have the upper hand on choosing and attacking their potential victims.",agreed
"By revoking peoples right to bare arms I didn't mean that the government is to swoop down and forcefully collect everybody's guns, I was thinking of something a bit more gradual like perhaps starting with putting up restrictions to make it more difficult to buy a gun.
And on the second point I sincerely hope that all Americans aren't so hardened and cold that they could without even a second of hesitation pull out a gun and immediately shoot someone. To believe that any regular person no matter the country could easily gun down an other person is delusional. I'm not trying to be offensive and I understand that there are people that would have an easier time shooting someone than others but the reality is that most people would hesitate even for only the briefest moment and that moment can be vital to what happens next.",disagreed
"I agree with you on many of your points and in present day America changing the policy on guns would be extremely difficult but you must agree with me when I say that a country functions better without such an abundance of guns.
And I also agree that the incident in Connecticut could have most certainly been prevented should one of them had access to a gun.
I still stand by my belief that a country should in any case function better and be safer in the long run without such free access to guns.",disagreed
"I do not agree with you that a country can run better without the abundance of guns. I believe you are under the presumption that anyone can have acess to a gun. Not anyone however can have access to a gun so in other words, access to guns are not free. It is limited because there are other factors that helps to determine who is better suited for a gun. These factors includes criminal history or any mental evaluation and furthermore, the government keeps a registry for firearm holders and monitor their use by also requiring them to renew their registration yearly.",disagreed
That is a shame because crime wise many countries are functioning better.,disagreed
You cant compare one country to another when there is a difference in the sizes of the population as well as other social factors which can be responsible for one effect.,disagreed
I fear that I might have been unclear you see I accidentally strayed from the subject but I only wonder if you honestly believe that in the future America will have truly benefited from your current weapon policy. And you are correct the US can't be seen as one country when it comes to laws but gradually change the approach to guns in individual states. I admit its a bit naive of me to think that your entire country wouldn't be pissed about one of there rights. I want you to think past the inevitable impact of removing a right and think of the benefits afterwards granted that you aren't launched into a civil war in which case you'd be screwed.,disagreed
"By whom?

Why is a negro no longer 3/5 a person, then? That was in the Constitution.
You are overlooking the basic, transient, flexible nature of the Constitution.
Also, you are overlooking the ENTIRE premise of the debate: automatic weapons.",disagreed
"Yes, shooting an automatic weapon in a domestic area sounds like a fine idea. It's similar to gassing a house with a family in it in order to kill some ants. At least you killed all the ants, right?

You don't think that's a strawman argument?
Here's what happens with weapons: http://www.jahonline.org/article/1054-139X(95)00030-V/abstract 00030-V/abstract)
Education, on the other hand, is almost universally acknowledged as the best way for people to influence their government (without bloody revolution). An in fact, those with a low education are more likely to commit crimes (http://www.fightcrime.org/sites/default/files/reports/MI%20Cops%20and%20Tots_0.pdf)
So would it not make more sense for people to invest more energy and money in the education effort rather than the armament effort?",disagreed
"Do you realize that break-ins aren't always a one man job? And do you also know that some intruders wear body armor? Automatic weapons are more effective against such targets.

No, because it has happened in the past. Also, that was one of the main reasons the founders encouraged people to be armed.

Allowing citizens to own automatic weapons doesn't necessitate a draw on government resources.",disagreed
"If you read the original constitution, you would see that it did not stated ""blacks are 3/5 of a person."" What it sates is ""3/5 of all other persons"" because that portion of the constitution was referring to the population of the blacks.
And also automatic weapons has no bearing on an argument prohibiting the use of civilians for self defence.",disagreed
"It said that only 3/5 of the black population counted in representation for states, thus effectively making a black person worth 3/5. Regardless, this section was directly changed by the 14th Amendment. I don't understand why you are arguing whether or not the Constitution has been changed.
I'm saying automatic weapons are entirely superfluous if one wishes to protect him or herself. A small arm, or non-automatic weapon would suffice just fine.",disagreed
"There's really no way I can argue with you. Yes, shooting a spray of bullets at ""enemies"" will be more efficient than taking the time to individually shoot each person, but that does not necessitate owning automatic weapons.

Jesus christ, please stay on topic, this is getting exhausting. I earlier said, keep your arms. I'm not asking to deprive you of all guns, merely automatic.
This is a rather good site: http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcassaul.html 
It says that .2% (1/5 of 1%) of violent crimes are perpetrated with assault weapons (even using their broad definition). Therefore, to claim that you need an automatic weapon to defend you and your family against these hordes of automatic-weapon-bearing criminals is simply ludicrous.

No, but the billions (to trillions worldwide) of money spent on arming ourself with firearms could largely be used more efficiently spent on better educating a nation.",disagreed
"Throwing civilians at a criminal? Grabbing civilians by the legs and swinging them like a baseball bat?
I might question the effectiveness of such.",disagreed
"When someone (or multiple people) break into your house, seconds count. Especially when the intruders are armed.

How about shotguns? or pistols? They kill people just as well as an ""assault rifle"" and most are a lot cheaper. And no, you probably wont ever encounter a situation in which you NEED an automatic. Just like you will probably never NEED to use a concealed weapon for your own defense. But the point is that it's better to be allowed to have it on the chance that the need arises.

Sure it could. But making laws that decide where private sector money goes is called socialism. And socialism won't work in this country.",disagreed
"Then the conflict would only be delayed. There would be continually more public unrest and protesting until it eventually became violent just as it would be if they were confiscated.

I speak from experience on this particular topic, and it's not something that anyone wants to be faced with. But there are times when a person must protect himself and his family because he has a duty to them and to himself. Even if that means killing the attacker.",disagreed
"I deeply apologize for the error in my argument. I meant the use of firearms for self defence. I was at the time, multi tasking so i am sorry about the error in my statement.",disagreed
"You said it yourself. 3/5 of the black population. Thus, there is a difference between a black person or any type of person being the value of 3/5 of a person and 3/5 of a population. But anyway back to the argument. I brought up the fact that the right to a firearm is within the constitution. You argued that the constitution is infallible or was changed. So you are the one that raised the effectiveness of the constitution, not me.
If a person chooses to have an automatic firearm or not, that is his decision, as long as he stays within the confine of the law because as a civilian, he has certain rights that the state cannot rid him of and the claim that owning a firearm is a potential for further criminality in a given population is a broad generalization in an argument without proper proof to prove so.
Furthermore, if you are claiming that possession of gun leads to further criminality then i am surprised that your perception of small non automatic guns is different because gun in the whole can be a danger depending on how and where you use it. Your solution to a problem will have no effect on the problem at present if that is what you are proposing for a change.",disagreed
"I don't think you understand math.

Which one? It can't be both. I'm fairly certain I argued the Constitution has been changed, and your refusal to accept a basic understanding of history does not change history.

Speaking of broad generalizations...",disagreed
"There is literally no point in arguing this. It is not so much you have convinced me of anything, or I feel like you make valid points, so much as it is that you are so entrenched in your ideas of why one should be able to carry deadly weapons and inflict deadly harm on someone at any time that I cannot even hope to ""win"" the debate.
Also, this debate is entirely unrelated to socialism.",disagreed
"I dont think you understand english enough to understand the difference between the words ""person"" as you claimed earlier and the term ""population."" Your argument is based on a phrase of the constitution which you yourself is not sure what the correct meaning of that phrase is. If you were smart enough you would figure that when i was referring to ""certain rights"" i was referring to the 2nd ammendment. You should probably check up the meaning of ""broad generalizations"" as well because it seems you have an issue in understanding the basics of english.",disagreed
"Its ok to stray off topic sometimes to establish your point. How can we know if this country will benefit from that policy until you give them a chance to put it into effect. And like i would have mentioned earlier in my argument, the use of firearms in the home for self defence has helped to save many lives in the past and majority of the crimes committed are committed by illegal firearm holders. This should be a clear indicator that legal ownership of guns in no way has increased potential criminality for law abiding citizens. I strongly think that if you remove that rights and lets assume that a civil war occurs. Now lets think past that, dont you think the civil war will cause the economy as well as the social structure of this country to collapse and plunge us into a new era of severe depression?",disagreed
"Under that logic, we shouldn't allow anyone to have guns since they may one day snap and go on a shooting rampage. In fact, we really shouldn't even allow people to have cars since they may snap and mow down pedestrians, or ram a school bus. Come to think of it, we might as well just lock everyone up in padded cells so that no one can get hurt ever.

Actually hunting accidents are very rare, and when they do happen, it is usually due to the elements, not a misfire. Furthermore, hunting with automatic weapons is illegal, unnecessary, and not the topic of this particular debate. There are many gun restrictions specific to hunting that don't apply for other types of shooting.

It is impossible to ever be able to guage how responsible someone is 100%, and it will always be fraught with bias. That doesn't mean we should eliminate a right because there have been a few wing nuts out there.",disagreed
"The Constitution was not taking a census, you do realize. They were saying that 3/5 of ""all other persons"" (i.e. slaves and other racial minorities) counted toward representation. Thus, the 14th Amendment changed this and made every person count toward representation. Effectively, it legitmized the position of former slaves as full citizens, whereas before they were clearly not.

And what I'm saying is these rights are not absolute. You do not get to own whatever you want whenever you want. You don't get to automatically own incredibly dangerous weapons. Or else why couldn't a citizen own a nuclear warhead, or why are there regulations on gun ownership like licensing?",disagreed
"Now that you have taken a proper approach towards your argument, i do agree with you that they were referring to as blacks and other minorities including the native indians as well as ""3/5 of all other persons"" because the presence of the British was still influencing America at that point and the rise of Civil Rights Movements caused the blacks to be free from slavery through rebellion against the Dictators. However, at that point, the constitution was never reviewed and was recently created by the wealthy upper class white members of society who thought that their actions were wise. Further review of the constitution lead to the institution of the 14th ammendment and due process clause. But as it is, the constitution has been reviewed for years and found to be appropiately fair not only by legislators but by several courts and human rights committee including the U.S Supreme Court.
If you recalled in my argument, i did not mention the term ""broad rights,"" instead i mentioned the term ""certain rights."" This certain right was referring to the the use of applicable firearms for self defence and automatic firearms were ruled to be liable for self defence. So, certain rights would extend to the use of automatic firearms for the use of self defence by civilians. And you said it yourself, the people's actions are limited by the government through the process of licensing, thus, through this process, the government gets to monitor the use of firearms by the civilian population.",disagreed
And thus the government may decide what is sufficient in order for civilians to defend themselves. I believe automatic weapons do not fall within that domain.,disagreed
"If you believe automatic weapons do not fall within that domain then point to a specific clause stating or proving your point. What you believe is your opinion, not the fact.",disagreed
My argument is stated in previous entries.,disagreed
"Your argument is based on your opinion. I dont need to hear your opinions. I need to hear your proof. You said that the people's use of firearm is restricted, so if that truly is the case, then point to specific clause, stating so in any parts of the constitution or the bill of rights, since that is the ultimate source of rights.",disagreed
"And as we discussed, it is not really the Constitution that is the ""source of rights."" Rights may not be decided on the whim of a document or a people, otherwise then they're not rights, they're privileges.
Therefore, I only need prove that the ""rights"" given to us by the Constitution have ever been limited by actions from the government, to extend that as well to the 2nd Amendment. Take free speech, which has often times been limited by the government (e.g. you cannot yell ""fire"" when there is in fact no fire) when it is deemed that said right may be dangerous for other civilians. Similarly, the 2nd Amendment may be, and should be, limited in scope by restricting the general population from owning automatic firearms. Actually one is more likely to be involved in a homicide if one owns a gun, among a myriad of other statistics (see link). Additionally, countries with more restrictive gun control laws tend to have a higher homicide rate. Making guns more available, as well as increasing the firepower and killing power of a single weapon would dramatically increase one's susceptibility to violent crime via guns.",disagreed
"The constitution is mot merely privileges, it is a source of rights. Point out one phrase in the constitution that mentions the terms ""privileges."" However you will find many of the terms listed as being ""rights."" You claim that rights have not been decided merely on the basis of a document but bear in mind rights were decided by the U.S Supreme Court on the every document that we should refer as being the constitution of the United States.
The rights guaranteed in the constitution cannot be limited unless one trespasses the limits of these constitutional rights which are no longer protected by the government. Yelling fire in a crowd when there is no fire is not free speech as you claim because according to the law, it produces a bad result definitely, since it can cause panic and can even cause injury because people might try to escape in panic. In some instances, yelling fire in a crowd when there is no fire in a building can cause people to block up the exit leading to a depletion of oxyen which can result in people dying. Therefore, this is not a right as you claim. This is an act of crime that can result in severe danger or death to others. If i recall you stated in your argument that ""the 2nd Amendment MAY be, and SHOULD be."" The words ""may"" and ""should"" illustrates that not even you yourself is certain in whether your perception of this issue is actually factual or just opinionated. Furthermore, weapons in the whole can increase a person's susceptibility to commit violent crimes but if that is true then:
A) That includes and covers the possession and ownership of small guns as well so they should also be banned and
B) How come the crime rate for LEGAL OWNERS of firearms has been significantly lower than that of the crime rate for ILLEGAL FIREARM OWNERS?",disagreed
"You misunderstand my problem with so-called ""rights."" I am saying rights (fundamental, universal, human) are not granted via a document or Supreme Court ruling. These rights would include liberty, pursuit of happiness, and equality. These are vague constructs, yet seem to be morally appropriate to guarantee to all human beings, and thus are rights of all human beings. The constitution attempts to distinguish specific ways to achieve these various UNIVERSAL rights, and thus they are limited in their focus and intent. That is why I would rather not speak of the Bill of Rights or the Constitution as a way of measuring a right but rather a privilege.

And thus you contradict yourself in one sentence. How can they not be limited, and yet still have limits, which trespassing those limits results in the creation of limits? My example of yelling fire in a crowd was a perfect example of even how freedom of speech (i.e. to say what you will when you will) is limited for the benefit of the majority. Thus we may place similar restrictions on other rights to benefit the majority.
Additionally ""may"" merely reflected the observation that the 2nd Amendment has been limited before, and ""should"" reflected my opinion that it should be. I'm sorry, your analysis of simple language mechanics is faulty, and it appears you seem to be grasping at straws.

No, they should be restricted. Like any policy, there is a ""sweet spot"" of regulation and freedom. Too much regulation and people no longer have the ""right"" and too little and it is nearing anarchy. Currently, it appears to me that gun laws are much too lax, and should be strengthened.

Do you see how I provided actual, factual statistics? Do you see how you have not?",disagreed
"First of all, prove to me that righ5ts are not granted via document or court ruling. The U.S Supreme Court has not granted any civilians rights but they have interpreted the rights available in the constitution and prohibit the government from violating these rights. If the Supreme Court and any document which you are claiming was not the source of rights, then why were various case laws made from these sources and why was the government prohibited from passing laws that would violate the constitutional rights of civilians. If i recall, the Supreme Court has dealt with various cases regarding racial bias, due process, 4 th amendment searches and seizures as well as racial stereotyping. The Court ruled in all these cases that due process and equality has been denied in these cases and therefore these people were freed because the source of their rights, the constitutional rights were violated. A privilege is something that you can take away whereas rights are something you cannot take from a citizen.
Again, you seem to be having a hard time in understanding the technicality of my perception. How can you call the commission of a crime as a right? If one does something that produces a bad result and can endanger other lives, how can you refer to that as being a right or privilege? What you are referring to is not freedom of speech. That is referred to as a crime. There is a difference between something that we enjoy as a right but does not protect us from committing crimes. For example, the freedom of speech also extends to actions, meaning that we have a right to display our actions, so lets assume that i have a right to free speech, does that mean i can go and burn down buildings or killing people to get my message across because i have a right to free speech? Again, your example is a crime and not a right. You should read up on what adds up to a right and a crime respectively.
If i was in a debate in court and used the term ""MAY"" people would assume i myself am not sure of the point i am trying to get across. That proves that you are not certain if what you are saying is the truth or you think it might be true or not true what you are saying. My analysis of simple language is based on the language you put forth so don't blame me for observing for what is put forth in front of me. Let me give you an example, if cops arrive on a scene to arrest a person and the person is suspected of being in a building so the cops approach you and ask you if he is in the building or not and you respond by saying ""MAYBE"" then that means that you are not sure but you think he might be. You see the difference between certainty and uncertainty and how words illustrate our inner opinions or may contradict our points?
I think you are failing to realize or accept that restrictions will have no effect on guns. These people need to be monitored. What evidence have you provided? Factual evidence from the FBI? Which is responsible for collecting and storing records of crime?",disagreed
"Our perceptions of rights differ in my definition is an absolute, i.e. rights exist regardless of documents, and yours are relative, i.e. a document provides them and thus are limited by those who are governed by those documents. Does that clear up the matter?
I said, ""You may pass me the cheese now,"" quite obviously I am not having uncertainty over whether or not I will receive cheese, I am merely being polite and saying you are physically allowed to pass me the cheese. I believe I was referring to restricting the second amendment in this way, i.e. we are allowed to limit/regulate that right.

And thus, you completely ignored my simple request. I did provide several studies (though embedded in an article). And for someone who has such little faith in government (after all, we need all the guns we can get to protect ourselves from their tyranny), you would still trust their studies?
(http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/homicide/weapons.cfm)
(http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/tables/firearmnonfataltab.cfm)
Are those enough trends?",disagreed
"I think you are misunderstanding the perception of what importance that document serves. You are forgetting that since we do not get our rights from the government, there needs to be a document which is the ultimate source of rights that serves the purpose of preventing the government from infringing upon our rights since government tends to act in conflict to the interests of its people. Let me remind you that when this constitution was created back then, it first had to be approved by the people before it could become effective and to this day, it still is accepted and approved by the majority of the population. You are failing to understand that there is a difference between what you referred to as being a crime and what is actually a right. How can we have a right to commit a crime when the example you gave is clearly a crime? Governments are not limiting our rights because the right you are referring to is not a right but rather a crime, therefore that cannot be found in the source of rights because it is a violation of the laws.
If you said to me that you MAY pass me the cheese, you used the term MAY because you are not certain if i will. If you used the term PLEASE, then you are displaying a sign of politeness.
Finally, i did take a look at those statistics you sent to me and there is one major problem that i observed. Why is it that your graph fails to point out what proportion of these crimes were committed by legal or illegal firearm holders? As far as i am concerned, all these crimes could have been committed by illegal firearm holders because the graph itself fails to refer if these gun crimes were committed by illegal and or legal firearm holders, thus the proof you sent me still do not justify the point you are trying to make. I am surprised that you questioned my faith in a government by trusting their statistics when your argument illustrates a low level of faith in the government, but yet at the same time, you are using government statistics. And like i mentioned, your studies make no distinctions of gun crimes committed by illegal and legal firearm holders so how are we supposed to figure out which category makes up the larger portion of those crimes committed?",disagreed
"I'm saying that the whims of the majority do not guarantee, grant, or deny anyone rights. Thus, neither does the document. Rights are an intrinsic aspect of an existence. You may not say, ""Oh, I don't like him, so I'm going to write a document and get it approved by the governing force to take away his rights."" Do you recognize how ridiculous that is?

Please, give this up. This is a very small straw you're grasping at. Focus on substantive parts of my argument.
How about a quote:
""In the 1992-93 Kansas City experiment, a number of police officers in the inner city of Kansas City were put specifically and entirely on the duty of searching for and eliminating illegal firearms. This heightened crackdown took place over a period of 29 weeks, after which results were studied and compared with those of the first, unchanged 29 weeks. After the 29 weeks of heightened activity against illegal firearms, the rates of gun crimes in the part of the city monitored decreased significantly, by almost 50%, whereas the ""control"" section of the city, in which a crackdown on illegal guns was not enforced, experienced no change in its crime rate.""
Quite obviously, if police crack down on illegal firearms, and gun crime rate decreases by almost 50%, you see that most gun crime is committed by illegal firearms. That is why it stands to reason that by making more powerful guns more readily available, crime rate would probably be increased because criminals would have much greater access to much more powerful weapons. Please, read the site i provided earlier: http://www.guninformation.org/
Also, it appears that yet again, I am the only one providing a factual, statistical backup for my responses.",disagreed
"It amazes me that you seem to be having a hard time to grasp the point i am trying to make. If the rights come from the people, then it takes majority of the people to put that right into effect. Rights do not just come from anywhere, they come from the people. One senior prosecutor examined your argument last night and told me to ask you, if you do not need a document to prove that you have rights, then how come you need a document to prove in a court of law that you are innocent when you are already innocent and also said that you should point to any specific part of the constitution that states the term ""privileges."" Why would the people write a document to take away somebody else rights when the same rights that they have created for themselves would apply to all citizens of that country. Do you know how ridiculous that argument sounds?
If there was a crack down on illegal firearms, then that points out to the fact that if government monitors the using of firearms by civilians then the level of firearm crimes will decrease. This is a form of monitoring in which certain requirements are not met, so the government seizes hold of that firearm until the requirements are met. If most gun crimes are committed by illegal firearm holders then it means that legal ownership of firearms combined with government monitoring can have a positive effect.
The site that you provided me with seems to be lacking impartiality since it seems to be biased. At the beginning of the site, the author did not post his name (i wonder why nor the date the information was last updated or published) and because of his bias and lack of impartiality, any information obtained would be biased since he is obtaining information to satisfy his level of bias. In all of his argument or evidence, he introduced sources who were biased to gun rights which leads me to wonder why did he not introduce sources favorable to gun rights and then produce counter sources to counter act the point made by those sources?
Secondly, some of the sources were from religious sources which is an issue since sources that are religious in nature would tend to mix religion with logic.
Thirdly, some of the results in the research were conducted in different countries, which is unacceptable for me to read since you cannot in any way compare a country to the United States because there can be more than one factor that can be causing the gun crime rate there and also there is a difference in the size of the country and the population as well as social issues.
""Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz have found that as many as 400,000 people per year use guns in situations in which they later claimed that the gun almost saved their lives. Even if these estimates are off by a factor of 10, it means that armed citizens may save 40, 000 lives yearly"" (Siegel, Larry J. (2008), Introduction to Criminal Justice (12th Ed.), pg. 70)
Also the source of the problem is illegal firearm ownership because according to the National Crime Victimization Center, illegal firearms are used in about 20 percent of robberies, 10 percent of assaults and 5 percent of rapes. Therefore, if you outlaw automatic guns criminals will still have access to these guns because there are still gangs who have access to these guns and can sell them to earn a profit.
""Banning the use of firearms will lead to that gun having more value which can lead to an increased trafficking in gun as well as other illegal substances (Siegel, Criminology: Theories, patterns and typologies 10th Ed. pg. 50)",disagreed
"So what you're saying is rights are decided by a majority? You have the freedom of speech because a bunch of people voted that people should be allowed to speak there mind? Does that not also imply that rights may be taken away in a similar manner? Therefore, that ""right"" is not so much a right in that it is yours no matter what as much as it is a privilege granted to you by a population. I am saying rights are absolutes, transient of any human document. You're saying rights are fabrications of a human society and thus vary not just from place to place but person to person as well. I do not understand how a document is proof. A document proves something has happened before. It does not physically allow or disallow you to do things. A document really has no power beyond the power people place in it.

It doesn't. I'm just disputing your concept of what is a right.

That was the entire point.

Your entire argument was based on the efficiency of government monitoring and thus being able to crackdown on illegal firearms (I think. Your argument was confusingly worded, e.g. ""certain requirements""). Why did you suddenly lump ""legal ownership of firearms"" into the argument when you had previously not substantiated that claim?
""'Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz have found that as many as 400,000 people per year use guns in situations in which they later claimed that the gun almost saved their lives. Even if these estimates are off by a factor of 10, it means that armed citizens may save 40, 000 lives yearly' (Siegel, Larry J. (2008), Introduction to Criminal Justice (12th Ed.), pg. 70)""
This argument is actually addressed by a Harvard professor of Health Policy, David Hemenway. He states:
""Since a small percentage of people may report virtually anything on a telephone survey, there are serious risks of overestimation in using such surveys to measure rare events. The problem becomes particularly severe when the issue has even a remote possibility of positive social desirability response bias. Consider the responses to a national random-digit-dial telephone survey of over 1500 adults conducted in May 1994 by ABC News and the Washington Post. [34] One question asked: 'Have you yourself ever seen anything that you believe was a spacecraft from another planet?' [Page 1438] Ten percent of respondents answered in the affirmative. These 150 individuals were then asked, 'Have you personally ever been in contact with aliens from another planet or not?' and 6% answered 'Yes.'By extrapolating to the national population, we might conclude that almost 20 million Americans have seen spacecraft from another planet, and over a million have been in personal contact with aliens from other planets. That more than a million Americans had contact with aliens would be incredible news--but not the kind actively publicized by reputable scientists.""

Yes of course, and you aren't either?

And what exactly is your basis to say that religious people would falsify data or conduct irresponsible surveys? You imply that religious people are illogical (or that the two are mutually exclusive) but I have met very many religious people who are exceptionally logical. Actually, it would be ILLOGICAL to come to the conclusion that there is absolutely no way religion is right about (a) god(s), as it is simply impossible for either side to prove existence or nonexistence. Therefore, to assume that religious people are illogical would be itself a logical fallacy.

Yes of course, you may not compare other countries to the US when talking about guns, except of course when it's the countries with low crime rates and low gun control.

And making guns more available will actually have the opposite effect, right? Making automatic weapons cheap and readily available will completely disincentivize ownership of automatic weapons.",disagreed
"Rights have always been decided by the majority because it takes the cooperation of the majority to put it into effect. But anyway since we both agree that rights exist but we disagree on the sources of rights i will address that. Th constitution is a document that was written and preserved and handed down from one generation to the next. It is a living proof that we are protected by rights which guarantees protection from the government. Before that constitution, was created, majority of the people voted for it to be put into effect. If you don't believe that rights come from the majority then how come laws are created with the approval of majority of the population? How come before we can over throw a government, majority of the votes from the population needs to outweigh the minor? How come when a Supreme or Appellate Courts decides a case, it takes majority of the votes to make a decision in that case? The human society was and is constructed in such a way that the larger population decides what is a right and hardly have they taken away a right from somebody else. Didn't majority of the population voted for certain actions to be labelled criminal, so would you say that is unfair because majority of the population took away the right from another civilian to commit a crime? That is the very reason why a document has power, because it is made up of the power THE PEOPLE gave it that power which serves as a proof against governmental infringement of our rights. Furthermore, at that time the constitution was created, there was no opposition to it from the people.
I am surprise you were arguing earlier that the constitution is privileged but yet in the same document you are disputing you cannot point to one specific word pointing to privilege meanwhile at the same time you will find many amendment such as the 4th amendment beginning with ""the right of the people.""
It is interesting that you do not see ""certain rights"" as related to the 2 amendment as i am explaining and repeating myself for the 3rd time which goes back that firearms CANNOT be restricted to people especially since it is designed in a way that is useful for self defense (Automatic firearm). If you don't understand government monitoring to be legal ownership then i advise you to put your critical thinking skills to work before responding to an argument.
Your argument and the evidence you introduced is weak. The source i introduced is a source that is valid and is being used by all schools offering law and pre-law countrywide. Moreover, the author of that textbook is the chairperson of John Jay School of Criminal Justice as well as a professor at many other law schools. He is also a criminologist and one of the most recognized authors. Secondly, how do you know that these surveys were completed via telephone? How do you know that these researchers were not representing a government funded research? I see no point in a rebuttal that has nothing to do with the source i have introduced.
He said that he would like to introduce information pertaining to gun control and introduced sources which were from religious sources and other sources that all demonstrated campaigns against firearm rights in general. Why did you not answer the part where i asked you why he did not introduced statistics from the supporter researches of gun rights and why does he fail to mention his name? We are in a debate but he is introducing factual information, thus there is a difference between my method of debating and his method of presenting information.
Sources that are religious tend to produce bias information because their emotions prevents them from accepting logical information in terms of issues pertaining to social structure. I did not in any way mentioned they are illogical or logical. My point i am trying to establish is that they have a religious view on certain logical issues that causes them to produce information to satisfy their logic. Take abortion and prostitution as examples. Also if you recall my point i said MIX RELIGION WITH LOGIC. What part of that statement points to what you are illustrating?
Low crime rates can be the result of better social structure and not just low gun rate. It could be the result of a smaller population and better availability of education and jobs. These are all issues pertaining to crime so hence, your argument is merely opinionated rather than factual.
The point that you are failing to understand that illegal firearms will contribute to more people owning guns illegally without the government having any knowledge thereof and can cause a increase in crime. Therefore the best form of system is a system of monitoring firearms users, not restrict them.",disagreed
"I can essentially ignore the rest of your argument and point out one specific point:

Firstly, of course my argument is opinionated. That is what an argument is. It is based on facts (and you calling them ""weak"" simply because the other did not provide you facts that you would like to have used does not negate that he does in fact present facts).
Secondly, yes, your argument about those issues all pertaining to crime is entirely valid. So why then can you say that if we were to have automatic weapons, we would be safer? Countries with legal automatic weapons would have different demographics. Various states have various demographics where perhaps an automatic weapon would be beneficial, as do counties, cities and neighborhoods. You must recognize that we must be able to compare a very broad swath of humanity (the US is a big place) and say that for the majority of places in the US, automatic weapons would not provide enough of a benefit to outweigh their risks.
Eh, I can't resist the rest of your argument. Well, most of it. I feel we should limit our discussion to the discussion of automatic weapons and thus eliminate our discussion of where rights originate as it has grown quite off topic. I'll make a separate debate for it if you wish.

I don't not understand your argument, it is just the phrasing and syntax is quite amorphous.

And my refutation of that source was a man named David Hemenway, a professor of Health Policy at the Harvard school of Public Health, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, among other titles related to the field of public health. I would posit he is a reliable source.

This is how I know, ""We use the most anonymous possible national survey format, the anonymous random digit dialed telephone survey."" (http://www.guncite.com/gcdgklec.html)

Because Kleck makes it quite clear that he does not accept the data compiled by the Bureau of the Census to be valid.

And thus they are illogical. I'm sorry, but that is what you are saying, and I find it incredibly narrow-minded to dismiss a survey (not an interpretation of a survey, but the survey itself) based on the fact that it was conducted by a religious organization.

That would be okay, but to introduce information that supports gun control? Off with his head! The point is, yes, if you bothered to read any of the rest of the site, you would notice that quite obviously the author is a gun control advocate. However, that does not dismiss the information he presented. Information is information.

Your first sentence is perhaps the most circular argument I've heard: illegal firearms will cause more people to own guns illegal because they will be illegal if people own them.
Obviously.
However, you fail to understand that if you make automatic weapons legal (and all weapons apparently. You say earlier in your argument suddenly that you are advocating a complete lack of restrictions on firearms, ""firearms CANNOT be restricted to people,"" although I believe we had previously discussed how it was necessary to restrict gun activities from various groups of people-like insane people or criminals-or to make it necessary for government regulation of the gun market. This seems like a frightening prospect, much more so than a restriction of automatic weapons.), the pool of automatic weapons will in fact enlarge, and more people will own them, and the weapons will be more accessible by those who may have been hesitant about ownership simply because of their illegal nature. Suddenly, it would seem more acceptable to rob a convenience store with an automatic weapon versus a handgun or a knife. Saying that having a small pool of automatic weapons leads to a greater number of people having automatic weapons is quite illogical.",disagreed
"unfortunately, automatic weapons were not designed for self defense, and I am not entirely sure where you pulled this misinformation from. I have here the patent for automatic arms.

It was designed by a military brigadier, so as to reduce reload times, and kill more enemy soldiers.
and here is the source stating that owning a gun increases the likelihood of getting shot.

I do agree that illegal firearm use is a more pressing issue than legal firearm use- yet this discussion is over automatic firearms, which is entirely unnecessary for self defense. Should a gun be needed, a rifle, pistol, or shotgun are more than necessary. Why take the unnecessary risk of using an uzi to shoot in self defense?",disagreed
"Are you saying that by being a law-abiding citizen, it becomes impossible to have accidents involving guns? Because as far as I know following the law does not make one an a sharp shooter capable of hitting ones attacker and nothing else.",disagreed
"That sentiment right there is preciely and exactly the reason US fatal firearm related deaths are usually about an order of magnitude higher than any other country every year, good luck with that.",disagreed
"That's quite a wild claim to make. These people were 'exterminated' by armies, I don't think if a Jewish citizen owned a gun in the holocaust they could defend themselves.",agreed
But then I could argue that there are countries with a lower crime rate and murder rate than Switzerland who do not allow guns.,disagreed
"That doesn't invalidate my point though, LOL. It just shows that we're both right.",disagreed
