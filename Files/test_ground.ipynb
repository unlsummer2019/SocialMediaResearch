If our government wants to control us with force they are not going to use pistols and hunting rifles, they will use the military and they use far more powerful weapons. the only way the people could successfully counter that is with weapons of near equal or greater power than what would be deployed by the military or non-violent movement such as the Indian Non-violence peace movement to overthrow the British Empire in India.',\n",

But do any responsible gun owners succumb to rage and utilize the tool that they carry for protection of themselves and others to kill someone? Aren't those feelings of rage and hate we feel internally slightly exaggerated? Would any sane, responsible person be able to act externally upon irritation, even with a tool readily available, to kill someone? I think not. Serial killers and criminals buy their tools to kill. Responsible gun owners, the ones that follow all laws regulating gun ownership, will not use the guns they acquired for a wholly distinct and opposite purpose to kill or hurt others.\",\n",

You're also wrong about guns making crime rates go higher, take a look at Switzerland. Men there are required to own automatic weapons and yet they have next to no crime rate. Their lack of a standing army is what was originally for seen for the United States, or a system similar. A small standing army to form the core of a greater force in times of war. That is what the second amendment implies.\\nObviously you know little about guns, a shotgun is probably one of the least threatening weapons to people. Their limited range for their weight and length makes them impractical for crime, but perfect for the defense of ones home.\\nThe guns aren't the problem its people and don't start blaming poverty, or education. Just because you're poor doesn't mean that you have to kill someone to improve your life. There are many ways to do that. So long as guns exist people will always find a way to acquire them. By reducing the number of honest, law abiding citizens with the capability to protect themselves from these criminals you're asking for a breakdown of order.\\nBut I diverge from the topic at hand. Point is only an idiot points a gun anywhere near a person they don't want to kill. There's no such thing as a gun related accident, gun related deaths almost always are caused by carelessness or stupidity or both.\"]"
